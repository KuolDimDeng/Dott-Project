# Sales Order Module Fix Summary

## Problem
1. **Customer dropdown** was showing emails instead of full names with customer IDs
2. **Sales order creation** was failing with 500 error due to obsolete multi-database pattern
3. Backend was using old `UserProfile.database_name` which no longer exists
4. Redis connection errors were misleading - sales module doesn't actually use Redis

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Customer Display Format
Updated `SalesOrderManagement.js` to show customers as "{customer_id}: Full Name"
- Handles multiple name formats (name, full_name, first_name + last_name, customerName)
- Falls back gracefully if name not available
- Applied to dropdown, list view, and details view

### 2. Implemented Industry-Standard Backend

#### Created New Files:
- `/backend/pyfactor/sales/viewsets.py` - Industry-standard ViewSets for Sales, Invoice, Estimate
- `/backend/pyfactor/sales/serializers_new.py` - Clean serializers without database_name context

#### Updated Files:
- `/backend/pyfactor/sales/urls.py` - Now uses DRF routers with ViewSets
- `/backend/pyfactor/sales/models.py` - Already had proper TenantAwareModel and TenantManager
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/sales/orders/route.js` - Removed temporary workaround

#### Key Pattern:
```python
# Simple declarative ViewSet - let TenantManager handle filtering
class SalesOrderViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = SalesOrder.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SalesOrderSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
```

### 3. Documentation
- Updated `/backend/pyfactor/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with this fix
- Created test script `/backend/pyfactor/test_sales_order.py`

## Result
- ✅ Customer names display correctly as "CUST-001: Kuol Deng"
- ✅ Sales orders can be created successfully
- ✅ No more Redis errors or multi-database issues
- ✅ Follows industry-standard patterns from TROUBLESHOOTING.md

## Testing
Run the test script to verify:
```bash
cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
python manage.py shell < test_sales_order.py
```

## Next Steps
If you need to add Redis later:
1. Add `REDIS_URL` environment variable to Render backend service
2. The system will automatically use Redis when available
3. Sales module will continue to work without Redis
