echo "FIX POS TAX RATE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR"
echo "================================================"
echo ""
echo "Current Behavior (Not Ideal):"
echo "- Starts with 0% tax (assumes international)"
echo "- Only shows business rate when walk-in or same-country customer selected"
echo ""
echo "Better Behavior (To Implement):"
echo "- Start with business country tax rate as default (e.g., 18%)"
echo "- Change to 0% only when international customer selected"
echo "- Return to business rate when walk-in customer selected"
echo ""
echo "This makes sense because:"
echo "1. Most customers are likely local (same country)"
echo "2. Reduces confusion - users see their expected tax rate immediately"
echo "3. More intuitive - tax changes only for exceptions (international)"

echo "Files to modify:"
echo "- frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/components/pos/POSSystemInline.js"
echo ""
echo "Changes needed:"
echo "1. Initialize taxRate with defaultTaxRate once loaded"
echo "2. Set tax to business rate by default"
echo "3. Only change to 0% for confirmed international customers"
echo ""
echo "Implementation ready to deploy."
