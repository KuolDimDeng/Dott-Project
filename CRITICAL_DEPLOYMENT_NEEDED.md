# üö® CRITICAL: Backend Deployment Required

## The Problem
Your backend is NOT running the fix that resolves the onboarding redirect issue. Users who complete onboarding are being sent back to onboarding because the backend can't find their tenant.

## Why This Is Happening
1. **Database**: Tenant table has `owner_id` as a CharField storing "17" (string)
2. **Backend Code**: Currently querying with `owner_id=17` (integer)
3. **Result**: No tenant found ‚Üí `tenantId: null` ‚Üí Redirect to onboarding

## The Fix
Commit `6b885bcc` has the fix that converts `user.id` to string before querying:

```python
# Before (currently running):
tenant = Tenant.objects.filter(owner_id=user.id).first()  # Returns None

# After (in commit 6b885bcc):
user_id_str = str(user.id)
tenant = Tenant.objects.filter(owner_id=user_id_str).first()  # Returns Tenant
```

## Deploy Now
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click on your backend service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
4. Monitor the deployment logs
5. Look for: "Deploy live for api.dottapps.com"

## What Happens After Deployment
- Users will be correctly redirected to dashboard after sign-in
- The backend will return `tenantId` in the profile response
- No more redirect loops to onboarding

## Quick Test After Deployment
```bash
# Clear cache and test
1. Open browser in incognito mode
2. Go to https://app.dottapps.com
3. Sign in with kdeng@dottapps.com
4. You should land on the dashboard, NOT onboarding
```

## Timeline
- Fix implemented: ‚úÖ Done (commit 6b885bcc)
- Frontend deployed: ‚úÖ Done (Vercel)
- Backend deployed: ‚ùå **NEEDED NOW** (Render)

Without this deployment, users will continue to be redirected to onboarding even after completing it.
