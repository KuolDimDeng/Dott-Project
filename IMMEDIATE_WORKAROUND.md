# Immediate Login Workaround

While we wait for the cache bypass to deploy, here are immediate solutions:

## Option 1: Use a Different Browser
1. Open Chrome, Safari, or Edge (not Firefox)
2. Go to https://dottapps.com
3. Try signing in

## Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open an Incognito/Private window in ANY browser
2. Go to https://dottapps.com
3. Sign in (private mode doesn't use cache)

## Option 3: Clear Firefox Site Data (Specific)
1. Go to Firefox Settings â†’ Privacy & Security
2. Under "Cookies and Site Data" click "Manage Data"
3. Search for "dottapps.com"
4. Select it and click "Remove Selected"
5. Also search for "api.dottapps.com" and remove
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Restart Firefox

## Option 4: Use Mobile Device
1. Use your phone browser (not on WiFi - use cellular data)
2. This will use a different DNS resolver

## What's Happening
- The DNS is actually fixed (api.dottapps.com works)
- Auth0 authentication works
- Firefox has aggressively cached the old DNS error
- The deployment includes cache bypass to prevent this

## Status
- Cache bypass code deployed at 01:11 UTC
- Should auto-deploy within 2-3 minutes
- After deployment, the login should work even with cached DNS
