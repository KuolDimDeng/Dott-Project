# Currency API Optimization - Production Fix

## Problem
- Currency preferences API was timing out after 10 seconds
- Users were unable to change currency from USD to SSP
- Error: "The operation was aborted due to timeout"

## Root Causes
1. **Redis timeout too high**: Redis socket timeout was set to 5 seconds, causing cascading delays
2. **No graceful fallback**: When Redis failed, the entire request failed
3. **Cache retry on timeout**: System was retrying failed Redis operations, doubling the delay

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Redis Configuration Optimization
- Reduced `socket_timeout` from 5s to 2s
- Reduced `socket_connect_timeout` from 5s to 2s  
- Disabled `retry_on_timeout` to fail fast
- Added health check interval of 30 seconds

### 2. New Production-Ready Currency API
Created `currency_views_production.py` with:
- Safe cache operations with 500ms timeout protection
- Graceful fallback when cache is unavailable
- Optimized database queries with `select_related`
- Proper error handling and logging

### 3. Frontend Timeout Handling
- Reduced backend timeout from 10s to 8s
- Added graceful fallback to defaults on timeout for GET requests
- Clear timeout error messages for PUT requests
- Proper error type detection and user-friendly messages

### 4. Performance Improvements
- Cache currency preferences for 4 hours
- Skip cache entirely if Redis operations are slow
- Return cached data immediately on cache hit
- Invalidate cache only on updates

## Files Changed
- `/backend/pyfactor/pyfactor/settings.py` - Redis configuration
- `/backend/pyfactor/users/api/currency_views_production.py` - New optimized API
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/currency/preferences-optimized/route.js` - Timeout handling
- `/backend/pyfactor/users/urls.py` - Updated to use production view

## Files Removed (Debug/Temporary)
- All debug endpoints (debug-500, minimal, test-auth, etc.)
- Test HTML files
- Temporary route variations (v3, simple, etc.)

## Benefits
1. **Faster response times**: Failed Redis operations fail quickly (2s vs 5s)
2. **Better reliability**: System continues working even if Redis is down
3. **Improved UX**: Users see cached data or defaults instead of errors
4. **Production ready**: Proper error handling, logging, and monitoring

## Monitoring
The new implementation logs:
- Cache operation durations exceeding 500ms
- All cache failures with error details
- Currency preference updates with user and business info
- Request durations for performance tracking
