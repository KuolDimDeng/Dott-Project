Current Fixes Summary

This document provides a summary of all the fixes applied to resolve the HTTPS, RLS, image loading issues, and dashboard rendering issues.

## 1. HTTPS Server Fixes

### Backend HTTPS Server
- Fixed certificate variable names in `run_https_server_fixed.py` to ensure consistent usage of `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE`
- Created a startup script `run_server.sh` that initializes RLS before starting the HTTPS server
- Added proper signal handling and error logging in the server startup process

### Frontend HTTPS Server
- Removed the invalid `server` property from `next.config.js` which was causing warnings
- Set image optimization to always be disabled (`unoptimized: true`) to prevent image loading failures
- Created environment variables to track HTTPS status in the application

## 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Fixes

### Database Session Parameters
- Created `init_session_rls.py` to properly initialize the PostgreSQL tenant context parameter at session level
- Added SQL functions (`set_tenant_context` and `get_tenant_context`) to handle parameter operations
- Fixed the RLS policy in the verification function to properly filter by tenant_id using type casting

### RLS Utility Functions
- Updated `set_tenant_context` and `get_current_tenant_id` functions to use the new database functions
- Improved error handling and logging for RLS operations
- Fixed policy syntax in the test verification to ensure proper tenant isolation

## 3. Image Loading Fixes

### UnoptimizedImage Component
- Created `UnoptimizedImage.js` as a drop-in replacement for Next.js Image component
- Added wrapper component `OptimizedImage.jsx` that automatically selects the right image component
- Disabled image optimization in next.config.js for development and HTTPS environments

### NextJS Configuration
- Fixed image configuration to allow loading images from all domains
- Corrected content security policy for image optimization
- Removed invalid configuration options causing warnings

## How to Apply These Fixes

1. **Start the backend server with proper RLS initialization**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/pyfactor
   ./run_server.sh
   ```

2. **Start the frontend server with HTTPS support**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/pyfactor_next
   ./start-https.sh
   ```

3. **For image components, use the optimized component**:
   ```jsx
   import OptimizedImage from '@/components/OptimizedImage';

   // Then use it as a drop-in replacement for Image
   <OptimizedImage
     src="/path/to/image.png"
     alt="Description"
     width={500}
     height={300}
   />
   ```

4. **To apply the dashboard rendering fixes**:
   - Ensure the script is included in layout.js:
   ```jsx
   <Script
     id="dashboard-multiple-render-fix-script"
     src="/scripts/Version0005_fix_dashboard_multiple_renders.js"
     strategy="afterInteractive"
   />
   ```
   - Verify the script registry is properly set up:
   ```bash
   ls -la frontend/pyfactor_next/public/scripts/script_registry.js
   ```
   - Monitor the browser console for "[RenderFixV5]" log messages to confirm the fix is working

## 4. Dashboard Rendering Fixes

### Multiple Render Prevention
- Created `Version0005_fix_dashboard_multiple_renders.js` to prevent duplicate script loading and improve error handling
- Implemented a script registry system to track loaded scripts and prevent duplicates
- Added improved error handling for network requests to prevent re-render loops
- Ensured AppCache is initialized only once to prevent race conditions

### Script Coordination
- Added coordination between scripts to prevent conflicts between different fix scripts
- Enhanced existing fixes with additional functionality
- Set global flags to indicate fix application status
- Created a comprehensive script registry in `script_registry.js` to track all fix scripts

## 5. AWS Amplify Network Error Fixes

### Authentication Network Error Handling
- Created `Version0006_fix_amplify_network_errors.js` to enhance AWS Amplify's network error handling
- Implemented a circuit breaker pattern to prevent excessive retries during network outages
- Added exponential backoff with jitter for more robust retry logic
- Improved error messages to provide better user feedback
- Patched the global fetch function to intercept and enhance AWS Cognito requests

### Sign-In Network Error Handling
- Created `Version0007_fix_amplify_signin_network_errors.js` to specifically target sign-in related network errors
- Implemented specialized handling for Secure Remote Password (SRP) authentication requests
- Added sign-in specific circuit breaker with cross-tab coordination for better user experience
- Ensured proper casing for Cognito attributes, particularly `custom:tenant_ID` with uppercase "ID"
- Enhanced CognitoAttributes utility with proper getters for common attributes
- Provided more user-friendly error messages during sign-in failures

### Fetch Interception
- Selectively enhanced fetch requests to AWS endpoints only
- Increased maximum retries from 3 to 5 with longer backoff periods
- Added detailed logging for debugging network issues
- Preserved original error information for troubleshooting

### How to Apply the Amplify Network Error Fixes
- Ensure the scripts are included in layout.js:
```jsx
<Script
  id="amplify-network-error-fix-script"
  src="/scripts/Version0006_fix_amplify_network_errors.js"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>

<Script
  id="amplify-signin-network-error-fix-script"
  src="/scripts/Version0007_fix_amplify_signin_network_errors.js"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>
```
- Monitor the browser console for "[AmplifyNetworkFix]" and "[AmplifySignInFix]" log messages to confirm the fixes are working

- Implemented a comprehensive solution for production deployment on Elastic Beanstalk

### Configuration Files
- Created `.ebextensions/04_django.config` with proper Django environment settings and static file configuration
- Added `.ebextensions/05_database.config` for RDS database connection and security group settings
- Created a dedicated `pyfactor/settings_eb.py` file for Elastic Beanstalk specific Django settings
- Added platform hooks in `.platform/hooks/` for pre-build, pre-deploy, and post-deploy actions
- Enhanced `application.py` with improved error handling and logging
- Optimized `Procfile` with better Gunicorn configuration for production use

- Fixed the version of urllib3 to 1.26.16 to ensure compatibility with boto3/botocore used by Elastic Beanstalk
- Updated both requirements.txt and requirements-eb.txt to use consistent versions of boto3 (1.26.164), botocore (1.29.164) and s3transfer (0.6.2)
- Enhanced the prebuild script to forcibly install the correct urllib3 version and prevent conflicts
- Removed problematic packages like textract that were causing dependency conflicts
- Created a comprehensive deployment guide to address common dependency issues

### How to Apply the Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Fixes
- Run the deployment fix scripts:
```bash
cd backend/pyfactor
python scripts/Version0007_fix_urllib3_conflict_v2.py
```

- Set the required environment variables in the Elastic Beanstalk console (see `backend/pyfactor/scripts/EB_Deployment_Fixes.md` for details)
- Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk:
```bash
cd backend/pyfactor
eb deploy pyfactor-env-fixed
```

- Or create a new environment:
```bash
eb create pyfactor-env-new -p python-3.9 -i t3.small
```

- For detailed documentation, see `backend/pyfactor/scripts/EB_Dependency_Conflicts_Guide.md`

## Known Issues

1. RLS verification may still fail in some cases, but the actual tenant isolation should work correctly.
2. Some image loading issues may persist until all components are updated to use the `OptimizedImage` component.
3. The database tenant context parameter needs to be initialized at the beginning of each session.
4. The emergency-menu-fix.js script is still loaded twice in the layout.js file, but our fix prevents the duplicate initialization.
5. During severe network outages, the circuit breaker may temporarily disable authentication attempts to prevent excessive retries.
6. Elastic Beanstalk deployment requires Redis either through ElastiCache or by disabling Redis-dependent features (Celery, caching, etc.).
7. When deploying to Elastic Beanstalk, dependency conflicts between urllib3, boto3, and botocore can cause deployment failures. The fix scripts ensure compatible versions are used.
