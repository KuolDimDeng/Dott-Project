# Branch Protection Setup for Production Safety

## GitHub Branch Protection (Recommended)

### How to Enable:
1. Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/KuolDimDeng/projectx
2. Click **Settings** → **Branches**
3. Add rule for `main` branch
4. Enable these protections:

### Recommended Settings:

#### ✅ **Basic Protection (Solo Developer)**
- [ ] Require a pull request before merging
- [ ] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- [ ] Include administrators (even you can't bypass)

#### ✅ **Medium Protection (Small Team)**
- [ ] Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer)
- [ ] Require status checks to pass (CI/CD tests)
- [ ] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- [ ] Require conversation resolution before merging

#### ✅ **Maximum Protection (Production)**
- [ ] Require pull request reviews (2+ reviewers)
- [ ] Require review from CODEOWNERS
- [ ] Restrict who can push to matching branches
- [ ] Require signed commits
- [ ] Lock branch (no one can push directly)

## What This Means:

With branch protection enabled:
1. **NO direct pushes to main** - not even with --force
2. **Must create a Pull Request** from staging → main
3. **Can add required checks** (tests must pass)
4. **Review required** before merge (can be self-review for solo)
5. **Audit trail** of all production deployments

## Your Workflow Becomes:

```bash
# 1. Work on staging
git checkout staging
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "Feature: XYZ"
git push origin staging

# 2. Test in staging environment
# https://staging.dottapps.com

# 3. Create Pull Request (PR)
# Go to GitHub and click "New Pull Request"
# Base: main ← Compare: staging

# 4. Review and Merge
# - Review changes
# - Click "Merge Pull Request"
# - Production auto-deploys
```

## Benefits:
- ✅ **Impossible to accidentally push to main**
- ✅ **Visual diff of all changes before production**
- ✅ **Rollback is easy** (revert the PR)
- ✅ **History of who deployed what and when**
- ✅ **Can require tests to pass first**
