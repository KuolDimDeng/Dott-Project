# Crisp Chat Auth0 Integration Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-01-06
## Version: 0100

## Issue Found
Crisp Chat was not showing because:
1. CrispChat component was only included in ClientLayout (via DynamicComponents)
2. Dashboard pages were using DashboardClientLayout instead, which didn't include CrispChat
3. The Auth0 migration didn't properly update the Crisp Chat authentication check

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added CrispChat to Dashboard Layout
**File**: `/src/app/dashboard/DashboardClientLayout.js`
- Added import for DynamicComponents
- Wrapped the content with DynamicComponents to ensure CrispChat loads on dashboard pages

### 2. Updated CrispChat for Auth0 Compatibility
**File**: `/src/components/CrispChat/CrispChat.js`
- Updated to accept `user` prop from Auth0
- Removed dependency on Cognito session fetch
- Fixed duplicate code issue

### 3. Created New CrispChatWrapper for Auth0
**File**: `/src/components/CrispChat/CrispChatWrapper.js`
- Uses `useUser` hook from Auth0
- Properly waits for Auth0 to load before rendering
- Passes user data to CrispChat component

### 4. Updated DynamicComponents for Auth0
**File**: `/src/components/DynamicComponents.js`
- Uses `useUser` hook from Auth0 instead of manual session check
- Simplified authentication logic
- Passes user data to CrispChat

### 5. Created Test Page
**File**: `/src/app/test-crisp/page.js`
- Test page to verify Crisp Chat functionality
- Shows session status and environment variables
- Provides debugging instructions

## Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID=82ce1965-8acf-4c6e-b8c0-a543ead8004e
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Deploy to Vercel** and verify environment variables are set

2. **Test Crisp Chat Loading**:
   - Visit `/test-crisp` page
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for `[CrispChat]` and `[DynamicComponents]` logs
   - Verify Crisp chat widget appears in bottom-right corner

3. **Check Dashboard Pages**:
   - Login with Auth0
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Verify Crisp chat widget appears
   - Test with authenticated user data

4. **Verify User Data Integration**:
   - When logged in, Crisp should show user email
   - Check console for user data being passed to Crisp

## Console Logs to Look For

Success indicators:
- `[DynamicComponents] Component created`
- `[DynamicComponents] About to render CrispChat with isAuthenticated: true`
- `[CrispChat] Crisp script loaded successfully`
- `[CrispChat] Set Crisp user email`

## Troubleshooting

If Crisp is still not showing:

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` is set in Vercel
   - Check if value matches: `82ce1965-8acf-4c6e-b8c0-a543ead8004e`

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check if `window.$crisp` exists
   - Look for network errors loading Crisp script

3. **Verify Auth0 Session**:
   - Check `/api/auth/session` returns valid user data
   - Ensure Auth0 cookies are being set properly

4. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for request to `https://client.crisp.chat/l.js`
   - Verify it loads successfully (200 status)

## Files Modified
1. `/src/app/dashboard/DashboardClientLayout.js`
2. `/src/components/CrispChat/CrispChat.js`
3. `/src/components/CrispChat/CrispChatWrapper.js`
4. `/src/components/DynamicComponents.js`
5. `/src/app/test-crisp/page.js` (new)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test on production
3. Monitor console logs
4. Verify Crisp chat appears on all pages
