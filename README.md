# Row-Level Multi-Tenancy Migration

This repo contains changes to implement row-level multi-tenancy, replacing the previous schema-based approach.

## 🔐 Authentication Architecture

**IMPORTANT**: This application uses **Direct AWS Cognito OAuth** integration, NOT AWS Amplify.

### Key Implementation Details:
- **Authentication Method**: Direct JWT token exchange with AWS Cognito OAuth endpoints
- **No Amplify Dependencies**: Bypasses Amplify v6 OAuth limitations and complexities  
- **Direct Token Management**: Custom implementation in `src/lib/cognitoDirectAuth.js`
- **Custom Attribute Extraction**: Directly extracts `custom:tenant_ID` and other Cognito attributes from JWT tokens
- **Callback Handler**: Uses `/auth/callback-direct` for OAuth flow completion

### Why Direct Cognito Instead of Amplify:
1. **Reliability**: No dependency on Amplify Hub listeners or session management
2. **Custom Attributes**: Direct JWT token decoding for `custom:tenant_ID` extraction
3. **Simpler Flow**: Direct token exchange without Amplify initialization delays
4. **Better Error Handling**: Clear, predictable error states
5. **Performance**: Faster authentication flow with fewer abstractions

### Authentication Flow:
1. User clicks Google Sign-In → Direct Cognito OAuth URL
2. Google authentication → Callback to `/auth/callback-direct`
3. Authorization code → JWT token exchange
4. Custom attribute extraction (`custom:tenant_ID`) from JWT payload
5. User routing based on tenant ID and onboarding status

See `DIRECT_OAUTH_SETUP.md` for detailed implementation documentation.

## Why Row-Level Multi-Tenancy?

Row-level multi-tenancy offers several advantages over schema-based approaches:

1. **Scalability**: Single schema makes it easier to handle a growing number of tenants
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: No need to manage multiple schemas
3. **Easier Backups**: Centralized data makes backups and restores simpler
4. **Reporting & Analytics**: Faster cross-tenant queries by eliminating schema switching
5. **Global Operations**: Easier to perform global operations across all tenant data

## Implementation Overview

The implementation includes:

1. Modified `Tenant` model (removed schema_name and related fields)
2. New `TenantAwareModel` abstract base class for tenant-specific models
3. `TenantManager` to automatically filter queries by tenant
4. Thread-local tenant context management
5. Updated middleware to set tenant context for each request
6. Modified database router for tenant-aware models
7. Migration command to transfer data from tenant schemas to the main schema

## Core Components

- `TenantAwareModel`: Base class that adds a tenant foreign key field
- `TenantManager`: Automatically filters queries by the current tenant context
- `tenant_context.py`: Functions to manage tenant context in thread-local storage
- `TenantMiddleware`: Extracts tenant information from requests
- `TenantAwareRouter`: Controls database operations for tenant-aware models

## Migration Steps

1. Run database migrations to update the models:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Run the migration command to transfer data from tenant schemas:
   ```
   # Migrate all tenants
   python manage.py migrate_to_row_tenancy --all
   
   # Migrate a specific tenant
   python manage.py migrate_to_row_tenancy --tenant-id <tenant_id>
   
   # Migrate a specific model
   python manage.py migrate_to_row_tenancy --all --model finance.Account
   
   # Dry run (no changes)
   python manage.py migrate_to_row_tenancy --all --dry-run
   ```

3. Verify the migration by checking data in the main schema:
   ```
   python manage.py shell
   ```
   ```python
   from custom_auth.models import Tenant
   from finance.models import Account
   from custom_auth.tenant_context import set_current_tenant
   
   # Set tenant context
   tenant = Tenant.objects.first()
   set_current_tenant(tenant.id)
   
   # Query tenant-specific data
   accounts = Account.objects.all()  # Will be filtered by tenant
   print(f"Found {accounts.count()} accounts for tenant {tenant.name}")
   
   # Access data across all tenants
   all_accounts = Account.all_objects.all()
   print(f"Found {all_accounts.count()} accounts across all tenants")
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with tenant context, ensure that `set_current_tenant()` is called before accessing tenant-specific models.
- The middleware automatically sets tenant context from request headers, session, or authenticated user.
- To manually set tenant context, use `set_current_tenant(tenant_id)` and `clear_current_tenant()`.

## Future Improvements

- Add database indexing optimization for tenant queries
- Implement tenant data isolation at the database level
- Add audit logging for cross-tenant operations
- Improve tenant context handling in async code

## Security Considerations

- Row-level tenancy relies on application-level filtering, so careful use of the ORM is essential
- Always use the tenant-aware manager (`objects`) for queries instead of `all_objects` except in specific admin scenarios
- Consider database-level security to complement application-level isolation

# JWT Expiration Handling Improvements

This update addresses the JWT token expiration issues that were causing users to be unexpectedly redirected during the onboarding process. The implementation focuses on gracefully handling token expiration, maintaining user state, and providing a seamless experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Backend JWT Expiration Handling
- Enhanced the `InvalidToken` error in `jwt.py` to provide more specific information when tokens expire
- Added detailed error response with clear action instructions for frontend handling

### 2. Token Refresh Management
- Created a centralized `authInterceptor.js` utility to automatically refresh tokens on expiration
- Implemented intelligent request queueing to handle concurrent requests during token refresh
- Added graceful fallback to sign-in when refresh is not possible

### 3. Onboarding Cookie Management
- Created a comprehensive `cookieManager.js` utility for consistent cookie handling
- Added backup storage options (localStorage) for resilience against cookie issues
- Implemented step tracking cookies for preserving onboarding progress

### 4. Middleware Enhancements
- Updated middleware to detect token expiration and redirect appropriately
- Added helpers to determine the current onboarding step based on cookies
- Improved onboarding path navigation to prevent loops and unnecessary redirects

### 5. API Route Error Handling
- Enhanced tenant API endpoints with better token expiration handling
- Updated business-info API to gracefully handle expired tokens during submission
- Improved error messaging and client-side feedback

### 6. Onboarding Layout Improvements
- Added proactive token refresh in the onboarding layout to prevent expiration
- Implemented a clear session expired UI for better user experience
- Added refresh indicators to show when token refresh is in progress

## Usage

The system now handles token expiration in these ways:

1. **Proactive refresh**: Tokens are refreshed before they expire
2. **Graceful handling**: If a token expires, the system attempts refresh automatically
3. **State preservation**: Onboarding progress is preserved in cookies and localStorage
4. **Clear feedback**: Users see clear messages when authentication issues occur

## Testing

When testing the onboarding flow, you should now see:
- Fewer redirects to the sign-in page
- Preserved form data between sessions
- Clearer error messaging when authentication issues occur
- More reliable progress through onboarding steps # Debug deployment trigger - Thu Jun  5 16:01:17 MDT 2025
