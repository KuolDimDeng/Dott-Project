# Backend Deployment Issue Analysis

## Current Situation
1. **The fix IS in the code**: Commit 6b885bcc has the correct implementation
2. **The fix is NOT deployed**: Render is running old code without the fix
3. **Evidence**: Backend logs show `Tenant lookup by owner_id ('17') result: None`

## The Problem
Your Render service is not running the latest code. This could be because:
- Auto-deploy might be disabled
- The deployment might have failed silently
- Render might be caching an old build

## What the Fix Does
```python
# OLD CODE (currently running on Render):
tenant = Tenant.objects.filter(owner_id=user.id).first()
# Returns None because user.id is integer 17, owner_id in DB is string "17"

# NEW CODE (in your repo, NOT deployed):
user_id_str = str(user.id)
tenant = Tenant.objects.filter(owner_id=user_id_str).first()
# Will return the tenant correctly
```

## Immediate Solution
I've pushed commit `09633586` to force a new deployment. 

**NOW GO TO RENDER AND:**
1. Check if auto-deploy triggered
2. If not, manually deploy the latest commit
3. Use "Clear build cache & deploy" if needed

## Database State
- User ID in database: integer 17
- Tenant owner_id in database: string "17"
- This mismatch is why the lookup fails without the string conversion

Once the deployment completes, users will be correctly redirected to the dashboard instead of onboarding.
