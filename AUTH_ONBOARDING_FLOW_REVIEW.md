# Authentication and Onboarding Flow Review

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Unified Authentication Flow
Created a unified authentication flow handler (`/src/utils/authFlowHandler.js`) that ensures both Google OAuth and email/password authentication follow the same user creation and routing logic.

### 2. Key Improvements

#### A. Consistent User Creation
- Both auth methods now call `/api/user/create-auth0-user` to ensure users get proper tenant IDs
- Backend creates OnboardingProgress records if they don't exist (fixes OAuth loop issue)

#### B. Unified Routing Logic
- Single source of truth for determining where users should be redirected
- Consistent checking of onboarding status from multiple sources
- Proper handling of edge cases (existing users, incomplete onboarding, etc.)

#### C. Session Management
- Created `/api/auth/update-session` endpoint for updating session data
- Consistent session structure for both auth methods
- Proper propagation of tenant IDs and onboarding status

### 3. Authentication Flows

#### Google OAuth Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" → redirects to Auth0
2. Auth0 redirects back to `/auth/callback`
3. Callback page uses unified flow handler
4. User is created/retrieved in Django backend
5. Routing based on onboarding status:
   - Completed → `/tenant/{tenantId}/dashboard`
   - Not completed → `/onboarding`

#### Email/Password Flow:
1. User enters credentials in `/auth/email-signin`
2. Authentication via Auth0 password grant
3. Session created with user data
4. Unified flow handler called (same as OAuth)
5. Same routing logic as OAuth

### 4. Onboarding Process

#### Simplified Onboarding (`/onboarding`):
1. Single-page form collects all information
2. Submits to `/api/onboarding/complete-all`
3. Backend creates tenant and updates all records
4. Auth0 metadata updated for persistence
5. Redirects to dashboard with tenant ID

### 5. Backend Fixes

#### OnboardingProgress Creation:
- `Auth0OnboardingCompleteView` now creates progress records if missing
- Prevents OAuth users from being stuck in onboarding loop
- Handles all user metadata properly

### 6. Removed Confusion
- Deleted all old multi-step onboarding files
- Single onboarding path at `/onboarding`
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Testing Checklist

### Email/Password Sign-in:
- [ ] New user signup creates account correctly
- [ ] New user is redirected to onboarding
- [ ] Completing onboarding redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Returning user goes directly to dashboard
- [ ] Sign out and sign back in maintains correct status

### Google OAuth Sign-in:
- [ ] New user is redirected to onboarding
- [ ] Completing onboarding redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Returning user goes directly to dashboard
- [ ] Sign out and sign back in maintains correct status
- [ ] No more onboarding loop for OAuth users

### Onboarding:
- [ ] Form displays correctly at `/onboarding`
- [ ] All fields are validated properly
- [ ] Submission creates tenant and completes setup
- [ ] User can select free or paid plans
- [ ] Completion redirects to correct tenant dashboard

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] User with tenant but incomplete onboarding
- [ ] User without tenant trying to access dashboard
- [ ] Session expiration handling
- [ ] Network errors during authentication

## Key Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `/src/utils/authFlowHandler.js` - New unified flow handler
- `/src/components/auth/EmailPasswordSignIn.js` - Updated to use unified flow
- `/src/app/auth/callback/page.js` - Simplified to use unified flow
- `/src/app/onboarding/page.js` - New main onboarding page
- `/src/app/api/auth/update-session/route.js` - New session update endpoint

### Backend:
- `/backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/api/views/auth0_views.py` - Fixed OnboardingProgress creation
- `/backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/fix_onboarding_completion.py` - Helper for onboarding fixes

## Next Steps

1. Deploy and test thoroughly in staging
2. Monitor logs for any authentication issues
3. Ensure all users can complete onboarding successfully
4. Verify OAuth users no longer experience loops
