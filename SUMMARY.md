# Summary of localStorage and Cookie Removal Project

## Overview
This project involved removing direct usage of localStorage and cookies for storing authentication and tenant data, replacing these with Cognito attributes and a global in-memory cache through `window.__APP_CACHE`. The goal was to ensure that tenant IDs and authentication data are managed securely through Cognito rather than client-side storage mechanisms.

## Files Modified

### Key Service Files
1. **apiService.js**
   - Replaced localStorage token storage with window.__APP_CACHE
   - Updated getAuthTokens() and logout() functions to use global cache

2. **persistenceService.js**
   - Replaced all localStorage operations with window.__APP_CACHE.tenant
   - Created __PERSISTENCE_STORE for structured data management
   - Added type checking for data serialization/deserialization

3. **onboardingService.js**
   - Replaced localStorage storage of onboarding data with window.__APP_CACHE.onboarding
   - Updated business info storage to use global cache

4. **userService.js**
   - Removed localStorage dependency for profile caching
   - Implemented memory caching with cross-component deduplication
   - Added global app cache for sharing profile data between components

### Key Hooks
1. **useTenantInitialization.js**
   - Removed localStorage for tenant locking mechanism
   - Updated tenant ID retrieval to prioritize Cognito attributes
   - Added direct Cognito attribute fetching through fetchUserAttributes()
   - Replaced local caching with window.__APP_CACHE.tenant

2. **useOnboarding.js**
   - Updated to store and retrieve onboarding state directly from Cognito attributes
   - Removed all references to localStorage and cookies
   - Implemented step progression logic based on Cognito attributes

### Tenant Management
1. **tenantUtils.js**
   - Created functions to manage tenant IDs through Cognito attributes
   - Added functions like updateTenantIdInCognito, getTenantIdFromCognito, and getEffectiveTenantId
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms to handle cases where Cognito data is unavailable

### Auth Operations
1. **cookieManager.js** and **tokenUtils.js**
   - Completely refactored to use Cognito for all auth operations
   - All functions now use Cognito's API for token management
   - Removed direct cookie and localStorage manipulation
   - Added documentation indicating that these utilities are being maintained for backward compatibility

2. **Auth Callback Routes**
   - Updated route.js to simplify token handling
   - Deprecated cookie setting APIs with warning messages for future removal
   - Added fallback mechanisms for legacy code paths

### Client Components
1. **DashboardClient.js**
   - Updated to check user attributes from Cognito instead of localStorage/cookies
   - Added utility functions to get business information from Cognito
   - Updated ClientDataSync component to use Cognito for tenant ID synchronization

## Global Cache Structure
Implemented a consistent window.__APP_CACHE structure with namespaced objects:

```javascript
window.__APP_CACHE = {
  // User profile data
  userProfile: {
    data: {...},
    timestamp: 1234567890
  },
  
  // Authentication tokens
  accessToken: "token_value",
  idToken: "token_value",
  
  // Tenant information
  tenant: {
    id: "tenant_id",
    initLock: {...}
  },
  
  // Onboarding data
  onboarding: {
    currentStep: "step_name",
    lastUpdated: 1234567890,
    businessName: "Business Name",
    businessType: "Business Type",
    step_business-info: {...}
  },
  
  // Persistence store (former localStorage data)
  __PERSISTENCE_STORE: {
    "subscription-data": {...},
    "selected-plan": {...}
  }
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Security**: Reduced attack surface by eliminating client-side storage of sensitive data
2. **Resilience**: App can function even if cookies are disabled or localStorage is unavailable
3. **Consistency**: All tenant and user data comes from a single source of truth (Cognito)
4. **Performance**: Memory caching improves performance while maintaining security

## Next Steps
1. Complete audit of any remaining localStorage/cookie usage in other components
2. Update the cookieManager.js utilities to be completely deprecated
3. Consider implementing a sync mechanism to periodically refresh the in-memory cache with Cognito data
4. Update documentation to reflect the new data storage approach
