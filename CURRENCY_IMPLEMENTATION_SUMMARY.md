- Tests business currency changes, invoice creation, and currency locking

## üîç Key Implementation Details

### Currency Flow Logic
1. **Business Currency Change:** Updates `BusinessDetails.preferred_currency_code`
2. **New Documents:** Automatically inherit business currency at creation
3. **Exchange Rates:** Captured and stored when document is created (if non-USD)
4. **Historical Preservation:** Existing documents retain original currency
5. **Currency Locking:** Prevents changes once document is sent/paid

### Compliance Features
- **Document Currency:** Each invoice/estimate stores its currency at creation
- **Immutable Records:** Currency locked when status changes to sent/paid
- **Exchange Rate Snapshots:** Historical rates preserved for audit trails
- **Proper Display:** Frontend shows document's original currency, not current preference

### Logging & Debugging
- **Frontend Logs:** `[CURRENCY-FRONTEND]` prefix for UI actions
- **Backend Logs:** `[Currency API]`, `[CURRENCY-INVOICE]`, `[CURRENCY-ESTIMATE]` prefixes
- **Currency Lock Logs:** `[CURRENCY-LOCK]` prefix for immutability actions
- **Preview Logs:** `[CURRENCY-PREVIEW]` prefix for display decisions

## üöÄ How to Deploy

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
python manage.py makemigrations sales
python manage.py migrate sales
```

### 2. Test the Implementation
```bash
cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
python sales/test_currency_flow.py
```

### 3. Monitor Logs
Look for the following log prefixes to track currency operations:
- `[CURRENCY-FRONTEND]` - UI currency changes
- `[Currency API]` - Backend preference updates  
- `[CURRENCY-INVOICE]` - Invoice currency setting
- `[CURRENCY-ESTIMATE]` - Estimate currency setting
- `[CURRENCY-LOCK]` - Currency immutability enforcement

## üìã User Experience

### For Business Owners
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Business ‚Üí Currency Preferences
2. Select new currency and confirm change
3. See clear message: "All new invoices and quotes will use this currency"
4. Existing documents remain in their original currency (compliance)

### For Document Display
- **New documents:** Show in business's current currency
- **Historical documents:** Show in their original currency
- **Clear indicators:** Currency symbols and labels show which currency is being used
- **USD Display Options:** Can toggle showing USD equivalent alongside local currency

## ‚úÖ Industry Standards Compliance

### ‚úÖ Document-Level Currency
Each invoice/estimate stores its currency at creation time

### ‚úÖ Immutable Currency
Once sent or paid, document currency cannot be changed

### ‚úÖ Exchange Rate Snapshots  
Exchange rates captured and stored at document creation

### ‚úÖ Historical Preservation
Past documents maintain their original currency for compliance

### ‚úÖ Audit Trail
Comprehensive logging for all currency operations

### ‚úÖ Display vs Transaction Currency
Documents display in their currency but payments process in USD

This implementation now meets all industry standards and compliance requirements while providing a smooth user experience.
