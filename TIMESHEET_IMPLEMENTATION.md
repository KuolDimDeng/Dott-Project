# Timesheet Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive timesheet system with the following features:

### 1. Backend Components (Django)

#### Models Created:
- **Timesheet**: Weekly timesheet with status tracking (draft, submitted, approved, rejected, paid)
- **TimeEntry**: Daily time entries with categories (regular, overtime, sick, vacation, holiday, unpaid leave, other)
- **ClockEntry**: Clock in/out entries with location tracking
- **TimeOffRequest**: Time off requests with approval workflow
- **GeofenceZone**: Location-based zones for clock in/out validation

#### API Endpoints:
- `/api/timesheets/timesheets/` - CRUD operations for timesheets
- `/api/timesheets/timesheets/current_week/` - Get/create current week timesheet
- `/api/timesheets/timesheets/{id}/submit/` - Submit timesheet for approval
- `/api/timesheets/timesheets/{id}/approve/` - Approve/reject timesheet
- `/api/timesheets/time-entries/` - Manage time entries
- `/api/timesheets/time-entries/bulk_update/` - Bulk update entries
- `/api/timesheets/clock-entries/` - Clock in/out operations
- `/api/timesheets/clock-entries/current_status/` - Get current clock status
- `/api/timesheets/time-off-requests/` - Time off request management
- `/api/timesheets/geofence-zones/` - Geofence zone management

### 2. Frontend Components (Next.js)

#### Main Components:
1. **Timesheet Grid** (`/dashboard/timesheets/page.js`):
   - Excel-style grid with green-shaded columns
   - Weekly view with navigation
   - Automatic totals calculation
   - Pay calculation for hourly employees
   - Submit for approval functionality

2. **Clock In/Out** (`ClockInOut.js`):
   - Real-time clock display
   - Location tracking toggle
   - Clock in/out/break buttons
   - Session duration tracking
   - Geofence validation

3. **Time Off Request** (`TimeOffRequest.js`):
   - Request form with multiple leave types
   - Full day/partial day options
   - Request history view
   - Status tracking

4. **Employee Settings** (`EmployeeSettings.js`):
   - Geofence zone management
   - Interactive Google Maps integration
   - Circle-based zones with radius control
   - Location requirement settings

5. **Supervisor Approvals** (`SupervisorApprovals.js`):
   - Pending timesheet approvals
   - Time off request approvals
   - Approval/rejection with notes
   - Real-time updates

### 3. Features Implemented

#### For Employees:
- Enter hours in Excel-style timesheet
- Clock in/out with optional location tracking
- Submit time off requests
- View timesheet history and status
- Auto-populated hours for salary employees

#### For Supervisors:
- View pending timesheets and time off requests
- Approve/reject with notes
- Real-time notification of submissions
- Bulk approval capabilities

#### For Admins/Owners:
- Configure geofence zones
- Set location tracking requirements
- Override approval workflows
- Access all employee timesheets

### 4. Key Technical Features:
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
- Location-based validation with geofencing
- Real-time clock tracking
- Automatic hour calculations
- Mobile-responsive design
- Industry-standard timesheet format

### 5. Integration Points:
- Integrated with existing employee management
- Uses session-based authentication
- Follows existing API patterns
- Compatible with payroll calculations

### 6. Next Steps for Production:
1. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations timesheets
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Add Google Maps API key to environment:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Configure geofence zones for each business location

4. Set up employee permissions and supervisor assignments

5. Test clock in/out with actual device locations

The system is now ready for employees to track time, supervisors to approve timesheets, and integrates seamlessly with the existing Dott platform architecture.
