# üîß Backend Application Fix Summary

## ‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified & Fixed**

### **The Problem:**
- **Database Connectivity Issue**: The Django application couldn't connect to the PostgreSQL RDS database
- **Security Group Mismatch**: RDS was configured to allow access from an old Elastic Beanstalk environment

### **The Error Logs Showed:**
```
django.db.utils.OperationalError: connection to server at "dott-dev.c12qgo6m085e.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com" 
(172.31.22.140), port 5432 failed: timeout expired
```

### **The Fix Applied:**
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-0d385b514eeee83dd \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 5432 \
  --source-group sg-01be0acaa5fe26ca3 \
  --region us-east-1
```

## ‚úÖ **Current Status:**

### **Backend Application:**
- ‚úÖ **Elastic Beanstalk Environment**: `DottApp-clean` - Running & Healthy
- ‚úÖ **Docker Container**: Running successfully 
- ‚úÖ **Database Connection**: Fixed (security group updated)
- ‚úÖ **Health Endpoint**: Working - `http://DottApp-clean.eba-dua2f3pi.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/health/` returns 200

### **HTTPS Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ **SSL Certificates**: Optimized to use single wildcard certificate
- ‚úÖ **CloudFront Distribution**: E1NYAUSVFSRF1D serving api.dottapps.com
- ‚úÖ **Cache Invalidation**: Completed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HTTPS Endpoint**: Still showing timeouts (CloudFront routing issue)

### **Security Groups:**
- ‚úÖ **RDS Security Group**: `sg-0d385b514eeee83dd` - Now allows current EB instances
- ‚úÖ **EB Security Group**: `sg-01be0acaa5fe26ca3` - Properly configured

## üîÑ **Next Steps:**

1. **Monitor CloudFront**: The HTTPS endpoint may need additional time for full propagation
2. **Test Endpoints**: Direct EB URL works, HTTPS domain should follow shortly
3. **Database Monitoring**: No more timeout errors expected

## üìä **Test Commands:**

### Direct Backend (Working):
```bash
curl -I http://DottApp-clean.eba-dua2f3pi.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/health/
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### HTTPS Backend (Propagating):
```bash
curl -I https://api.dottapps.com/health/
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 (once CloudFront routing is fully updated)
```

## üéØ **Summary:**
**The core backend application issue has been RESOLVED.** The database connectivity problem was due to a security group mismatch and has been fixed. The application is now running properly on the direct EB URL. The HTTPS domain may need a few more minutes for full CloudFront propagation.
