# Google OAuth Onboarding Persistence Fix

## Problem
After signing in with Google and completing onboarding, clearing browser cache causes users to go through onboarding again when they sign back in. This indicates the onboarding completion status is not being properly persisted or retrieved from the backend.

## Root Cause
The onboarding status is stored in multiple places:
1. **Session cookie** - Gets cleared when browser cache is cleared
2. **Backend database (OnboardingProgress model)** - Should persist but wasn't being checked comprehensively
3. **Auth0 user metadata** - Attempted but failing due to missing management API credentials

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Backend Completion Check (Frontend)
Updated `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/user/create-auth0-user/route.js`:
- Added more comprehensive backend completion check
- Now checks multiple fields: `onboarding_status`, `setup_done`, `onboarding_completed`, `setup_completed`
- Also checks nested onboarding object fields

### 2. Improved Profile Status Check
Updated `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/auth/profile/route.js`:
- Enhanced backend completion detection
- Checks additional fields including nested onboarding data
- Better handles edge cases where data might be incomplete

### 3. New Backend Endpoint
Created `/backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/api/views/onboarding_status_view.py`:
- New `UpdateOnboardingStatusView` endpoint specifically for updating onboarding status
- Ensures OnboardingProgress record is properly created/updated
- Updates user-tenant relationship
- Provides consistent status persistence

### 4. Frontend Already Calls Backend
The frontend onboarding completion (`/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/onboarding/complete-all/route.js`) already:
- Calls the backend to update onboarding status
- Updates session cookies
- Attempts to update Auth0 metadata (though this may fail without proper credentials)

## How It Works Now

1. **User completes onboarding**: Status is saved to:
   - Session cookie
   - Backend OnboardingProgress model
   - User-tenant relationship

2. **User clears cache and signs in again**:
   - Session cookie is gone
   - Frontend checks backend via `/api/users/me/`
   - Backend returns OnboardingProgress status
   - Frontend recognizes completion and skips onboarding

3. **Multiple status indicators are checked**:
   - `onboarding_status === 'complete'`
   - `setup_done === true`
   - `onboarding_completed === true`
   - `setup_completed === true`
   - Presence of valid `tenant_id`

## Testing Instructions

1. Sign in with Google as a new user
2. Complete onboarding process
3. Verify you're redirected to dashboard
4. Clear browser cache/cookies
5. Sign in with Google again
6. Should go directly to dashboard without re-onboarding

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Enable Auth0 Management API**:
   - Set `AUTH0_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables
   - This will allow storing onboarding status in Auth0 user metadata as additional backup

2. **Monitor Backend Logs**:
   - Check for successful OnboardingProgress updates
   - Verify tenant relationships are properly set

3. **Consider Adding**:
   - Database index on `OnboardingProgress.user` for faster lookups
   - Background job to sync onboarding status to Auth0 metadata
   - Frontend retry logic if backend check fails
