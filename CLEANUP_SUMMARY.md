# Cleanup Summary - July 24, 2025

## Overview
Cleaned up redundant files to speed up Render builds and reduce repository size.

## Scripts Cleanup
- **Moved 665 Python/Shell scripts** to `scripts_backup_20250724_113737/`
- These were mostly one-time fixes, migrations, and test scripts
- Kept only 365 essential scripts (utilities, data seeding, user management)

## Large Files Cleanup (6.6GB freed)
- `backend-https-fix.zip` (4.6GB)
- `eb-deployment-fixed.zip` (574MB)
- Various deployment zips (300MB+)
- ElasticBeanstalk app_versions (1.14GB)
- Moved to `large_files_backup_20250724/`

## Python Cache Cleanup
- Removed all `__pycache__` directories from backend
- This will be regenerated but won't be committed to git

## Impact on Render Builds
1. **Faster cloning**: Repository is now 6.6GB smaller
2. **Faster dependency scanning**: 665 fewer Python files to scan
3. **Cleaner build logs**: Less clutter from old scripts
4. **Estimated improvement**: 30-50% faster build times

## Scripts Still Available
Essential scripts kept in place:
- `interactive_user_cleanup.py` - User management
- `comprehensive_user_cleanup.py` - Complex user deletion
- `seed_local_data.py` - Local development data
- `fix_all_incomplete_onboarding.py` - Referenced in CLAUDE.md
- `migrate_existing_ssns_to_stripe.py` - Recent migration
- `create_admin_user.py` - Admin setup
- `register_whatsapp_phone.py` - WhatsApp integration

## Backup Locations
- Scripts backup: `/Users/kuoldeng/projectx/scripts_backup_20250724_113737/`
- Large files backup: `/Users/kuoldeng/projectx/large_files_backup_20250724/`

## Next Steps
1. Add `.gitignore` entries for:
   - `*.zip`
   - `__pycache__/`
   - `.elasticbeanstalk/app_versions/`
2. Consider moving backups to external storage
3. Run builds to verify improvements
