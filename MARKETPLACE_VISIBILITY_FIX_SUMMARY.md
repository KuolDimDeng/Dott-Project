# Marketplace Visibility & Menu Items Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Marketplace Visibility Toggle Not Working
**Problem**: User toggles visibility in Advertise screen but `is_visible_in_marketplace` remains `false` in database.

**Root Cause**: Mobile app's `handlePublish` function was sending entire nested profile object alongside visibility fields, potentially causing the backend to not process the visibility update correctly.

**Solution**:
- Modified `handlePublish` in `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/screens/business/MarketplaceProfileEditor.js` (lines 311-319)
- Changed from sending entire profile object to sending only the essential visibility fields:
  ```javascript
  const visibilityData = {
    is_published: newPublishStatus,
    is_active: newPublishStatus,
    is_visible_in_marketplace: newPublishStatus,
  };
  ```

### 2. Menu Items Not Showing in Business Details
**Problem**: Business details page shows business info but Menu tab is empty despite having menu items.

**Root Cause**: The `get_products` API endpoint in backend required `is_visible_in_marketplace=True` to return products, so when visibility was false, menu items couldn't be fetched.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `get_products` method in `/backend/pyfactor/marketplace/views.py` (lines 1172-1195)
- Added fallback logic to allow business owners to see their own products even when not visible in marketplace
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track menu item fetching

## Technical Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`/backend/pyfactor/marketplace/views.py`)

1. **Enhanced listing endpoint debug logging** (lines 1307-1333):
   - Added logging for current visibility status
   - Added detailed logging of what visibility fields are being updated
   - Added before/after save comparison logging

2. **Fixed get_products endpoint** (lines 1172-1195):
   - Removed hard requirement for `is_visible_in_marketplace=True`
   - Added fallback to allow business owners to access their own products
   - Added debug logging for business not found scenarios

3. **Enhanced menu items debug logging** (lines 1213-1238):
   - Added logging for restaurant detection
   - Added logging for menu items count (total vs available)
   - Added error tracebacks for menu fetching failures

### Frontend Changes (`/mobile/DottAppNative/src/screens/business/MarketplaceProfileEditor.js`)

1. **Simplified handlePublish function** (lines 311-319):
   - Removed sending of entire profile object
   - Send only essential visibility fields
   - Added debug logging for visibility update data

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Visibility Toggle**:
   - Toggle marketplace visibility in mobile app
   - Check backend logs for visibility update messages
   - Verify database field is updated correctly

2. **Test Menu Items Display**:
   - Ensure businesses with menu items can see them in Business Details
   - Check if menu items show even when business is not published to marketplace
   - Verify restaurant detection works correctly

## Debug Information Available

- All visibility updates now have detailed logging with `[VISIBILITY_DEBUG]` prefix

- Business owner access attempts are logged with `[PRODUCTS_DEBUG]` prefix

## Impact
