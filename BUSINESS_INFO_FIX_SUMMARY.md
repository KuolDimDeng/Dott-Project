# Business Info Tab Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The Info tab in the Business Detail screen was showing "No phone available" and "No address available" because the BusinessListing fields (phone, address, website) were null/empty in the database.

## Root Cause
- BusinessListing records were created but contact fields weren't populated from UserProfile
- No automatic synchronization between UserProfile and BusinessListing
- API returned null values for these fields

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Mobile App Fallback Values ✅
**File:** `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/screens/BusinessDetailScreen.js`

- Added fallback logic to display available data:
  - Shows `business_email` when phone is missing
  - Builds address from `city` + `country` when full address is missing
  - Displays default business hours when empty
  - Shows "Contact via email" when no phone number

### Phase 2: Backend Sync Command ✅
**File:** `/backend/pyfactor/marketplace/management/commands/sync_business_info.py`

- Created management command to sync existing data
- Maps UserProfile fields to BusinessListing:
  - `phone_number` → `phone`
  - `user.email` → `business_email`
  - `street, city, state, country` → `address`
  - `postcode` → `postal_code`
- Run with: `python manage.py sync_business_info`

### Phase 3: Auto-sync on Save ✅
**File:** `/backend/pyfactor/marketplace/models.py`

- Updated BusinessListing.save() method
- Automatically populates contact fields from UserProfile when creating/updating
- Sets default business hours if empty
- Future businesses will auto-populate

### Phase 4: Manual Sync API Endpoint ✅
**File:** `/backend/pyfactor/marketplace/views.py`

- Added `/api/marketplace/business/sync_business_info/` endpoint
- Allows businesses to manually trigger sync
- Returns list of updated fields

### Phase 5: Business Profile Editor ✅
**Files:**
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/screens/EditBusinessInfoScreen.js` (new)
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/services/marketplaceApi.js` (updated)
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/screens/BusinessMenuScreen.js` (updated)
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/navigation/MainNavigator.js` (updated)

- New "Business Info" menu option in business menu
- Full edit screen for contact info and business hours
- "Sync from Profile" button for quick updates
- Direct save to BusinessListing

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Backend Changes:**
   ```bash
   cd /backend/pyfactor
   ./scripts/deploy_business_info_fix.sh
   ```

2. **Run Sync Command:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py sync_business_info
   ```

3. **Deploy Mobile App:**
   - Build and deploy React Native app with updated screens

## Testing

1. **Check Info Tab:** Open any business in Discover → tap Info tab
   - Should show email address
   - Should show "Juba, South Sudan" as address
   - Should show default business hours

2. **Test Business Info Editor:**
   - Go to Business menu → tap "Business Info"
   - Edit fields and save
   - Check if changes appear in Info tab

3. **Test Sync Button:**
   - In Business Info editor, tap "Sync from Profile"
   - Should pull data from UserProfile

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/marketplace/business/my_listing/` - Get current business listing
- `POST /api/marketplace/business/my_listing/` - Update business listing
- `POST /api/marketplace/business/sync_business_info/` - Sync from UserProfile

## Impact

- **Immediate:** Users see business email and city/country in Info tab
- **After Sync:** Phone numbers and full addresses populated from UserProfile
- **Future:** New businesses automatically get full info populated
- **Self-service:** Businesses can edit their info directly in the app

## Files Changed

### Backend
- `/backend/pyfactor/marketplace/models.py` - Added auto-sync in save()
- `/backend/pyfactor/marketplace/views.py` - Added sync endpoint
- `/backend/pyfactor/marketplace/management/commands/sync_business_info.py` - New sync command

### Mobile App
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/screens/BusinessDetailScreen.js` - Added fallback logic
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/screens/EditBusinessInfoScreen.js` - New edit screen
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/services/marketplaceApi.js` - Added API methods
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/screens/BusinessMenuScreen.js` - Added menu item
- `/mobile/DottAppNative/src/navigation/MainNavigator.js` - Added navigation

## Notes

- UserProfile uses `phone_number` field, not `phone`
- UserProfile uses `postcode` field, not `postal_code`
- Default business hours are set if empty (Mon-Fri 9-5, Sat 9-2, Sun closed)
- Sync command has `--dry-run` option for testing
