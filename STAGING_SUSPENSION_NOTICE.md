# Staging Environment Suspension Notice

**Date**: July 24, 2025  
**Decision**: Temporarily suspend staging environment to focus on production

## Current Status

### âœ… Production Environment (Active)
- **Frontend**: https://dottapps.com (dott-front)
- **Backend API**: https://api.dottapps.com (dott-api)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (dott-db)
- **Redis**: Valkey 8 (dott-redis)
- **Status**: Fully operational

### ðŸ›‘ Staging Environment (Suspended)
- **Frontend**: https://dott-staging.onrender.com (dott-staging) - SUSPENDED
- **Backend API**: https://dott-api-staging.onrender.com (dott-api-staging) - SUSPENDED
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (dott-db-staging) - SUSPENDED
- **Status**: Temporarily suspended to reduce costs

## Rationale

With 0 active users, maintaining duplicate infrastructure is unnecessary overhead:
- **Cost Savings**: ~$57/month
- **Time Savings**: Single deployment pipeline
- **Focus**: 100% effort on acquiring first customers

## Development Workflow (Temporary)

1. **All development on `main` branch**
2. **Test locally before deploying**
3. **Deploy directly to production**
4. **Monitor closely after deployments**

## When to Reactivate Staging

Consider reactivating staging when:
- [ ] 10+ paying customers
- [ ] $1000+ MRR
- [ ] Multiple developers on team
- [ ] Handling sensitive customer data
- [ ] Need to test breaking changes

## How to Reactivate

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. For each suspended service:
   - Click service name
   - Click "Resume Service"
3. Update environment variables if needed
4. Deploy latest code from `staging` branch

## Cost Breakdown (Monthly)

| Service | Type | Cost | Status |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| dott-front | Docker Standard | $25 | Active |
| dott-api | Docker Standard | $25 | Active |
| dott-db | PostgreSQL Basic | $7 | Active |
| dott-redis | Redis | $10 | Active |
| **Production Total** | | **$67** | |
| dott-staging | Docker Standard | $25 | Suspended |
| dott-api-staging | Docker Standard | $25 | Suspended |
| dott-db-staging | PostgreSQL Basic | $7 | Suspended |
| **Staging Total** | | **$57** | Saved |

## Important Notes

- Authentication redirect fixes have been deployed to production
- All staging-specific code is environment-aware (will work when reactivated)
- Database migrations are tracked - staging DB may need updates when reactivated
- Focus on customer acquisition over infrastructure optimization
