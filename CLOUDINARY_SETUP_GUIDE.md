   - H.264 for universal playback
   - Automatic thumbnail generation

### Network-Adaptive Loading:
- **2G/Edge**: Uses ultra-compressed versions

- **4G/WiFi**: Uses high quality
- **Offline**: Uses cached URLs

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Upload Voice Note
```
POST /api/chat/conversations/{conversation_id}/upload-voice/
Body: multipart/form-data with 'audio' file
```

### Upload Image
```
POST /api/chat/conversations/{conversation_id}/upload-image/
Body: multipart/form-data with 'image' file and optional 'caption'
```

### Upload Video

### Check Usage (Admin Only)
```
GET /api/chat/cloudinary-usage/
```

## 📱 Mobile Integration

```javascript
// Upload voice note
import mediaUploadService from './services/mediaUploadService';

const result = await mediaUploadService.uploadVoiceNote(
  conversationId,
  audioFile
);

// Adaptive URL selection based on network
const url = await mediaUploadService.getAdaptiveMediaUrl(
  messageId,
  urls
);
```

## 🚨 Monitoring Usage

Check your usage to stay within FREE tier:

```python
# Django shell
from services.cloudinary_service import cloudinary_service
usage = cloudinary_service.get_usage_stats()
print(f"Storage: {usage['storage_used_gb']}/{usage['storage_limit_gb']} GB")
print(f"Bandwidth: {usage['bandwidth_used_gb']}/{usage['bandwidth_limit_gb']} GB")
```

## 💡 Tips for Staying in FREE Tier

1. **Enable Auto-Cleanup**: Old media deleted after 90 days
2. **Limit Video Duration**: Max 60 seconds per video
3. **Compress Before Upload**: Mobile app pre-compresses
4. **Use Thumbnails**: Load thumbnails in lists, full images on tap
