git commit -m "Fix React error #306 in Product Management navigation

- Remove memoization from ProductManagement component export
- Memoization was causing issues with lazy loading and React error #306
- Update SalesProductManagement to use dynamic import with Suspense
- Add proper loading states and client-side only rendering
- Match ServiceManagement pattern for consistent behavior

This fixes the 'Unable to load products' error when navigating
back to the Product Management page from other pages."
