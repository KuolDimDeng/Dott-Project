# Clear Browser Storage - Final Fix

The DNS is now correct and the backend is working, but your browser might have cached data.

## In Firefox Developer Console (F12):

1. Open Developer Console (F12)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Paste and run these commands:

```javascript
// Clear all storage for the site
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();

// Clear IndexedDB
indexedDB.databases().then(dbs => {
  dbs.forEach(db => indexedDB.deleteDatabase(db.name));
});

// Clear cookies for this site
document.cookie.split(";").forEach(function(c) { 
  document.cookie = c.replace(/^ +/, "").replace(/=.*/, "=;expires=" + new Date().toUTCString() + ";path=/"); 
});

console.log("All storage cleared!");
```

4. After running, close the Developer Console
5. **Hard refresh**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
6. Try logging in again

## Alternative: Complete Firefox Reset

1. Close all Firefox windows
2. Open Firefox in Safe Mode:
   - Hold Shift while starting Firefox
   - Or from Terminal: `/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -safe-mode`
3. Try logging in

## The Issue

- DNS is now correct (pointing to Render directly)
- Backend API is working (returns 401 for invalid credentials)
- Frontend might have cached the error or needs restart
- Your browser might have cached error data

## If Nothing Works

The frontend server might need to be restarted on Render to pick up the DNS change. This would require going to the Render dashboard and manually restarting the service.
