# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Fixes Applied

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Nginx Reload Command Error
- **Error**: "Command 01_reload_nginx failed"
- **Fix**: Removed nginx reload commands from container_commands
- **Script**: Version0095_fix_nginx_reload_deployment_issue.mjs
- **Result**: This specific error no longer occurs

### 2. ✅ Rolling Update Configuration Error  
- **Error**: "You can't enable rolling updates for a single-instance environment"
- **Fix**: Changed deployment policy to AllAtOnce in .ebextensions/01_environment.config
- **Result**: Configuration validation now passes

### 3. ✅ WSGI User Error
- **Error**: "wsgi is not a valid user name"
- **Fix**: Removed health endpoint config files using Python platform settings
- **Script**: Version0096_fix_wsgi_user_docker_deployment.mjs
- **Files Removed**:
  - .ebextensions/02-add-health-endpoint.config
  - .ebextensions/02-health-endpoint-simple.config
- **Result**: PreBuildEbExtension phase now completes

## Current Status
After applying all fixes, the deployment is still failing with a generic "Engine execution has encountered an error" message. This suggests the issue is now with the Docker container or application startup itself.

## Next Steps to Investigate

### 1. Access Instance Logs Directly
```bash
# SSH into the instance
aws ssm start-session --target i-0931d52a8fcd5f4ac --region us-east-1

# Once connected, check Docker logs
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker logs <container-id>
```

### 2. Check Application Requirements
- Verify all environment variables are set in EB console
- Ensure database connection settings are correct
- Check if all Python dependencies are properly installed

### 3. Review Docker Configuration
- Verify Dockerfile is building correctly
- Check if the application starts properly locally
- Ensure all required files are included in deployment package

### 4. Common Docker Deployment Issues
- Missing environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, etc.)
- Database connection failures
- Port binding issues
- Memory constraints
- Missing static files

## Deployment Scripts Created
1. `deploy-to-eb.sh` - EB CLI deployment (requires EB CLI)
2. `deploy-with-aws-cli.sh` - AWS CLI deployment
3. `deploy-clean.sh` - Clean minimal deployment package

## Configuration Files Status
- `.ebextensions/01_environment.config` - ✅ Fixed
- `.platform/nginx/conf.d/` - ✅ Created
- Removed problematic config files - ✅ Done

## Git Commits Made
1. "fix: Remove nginx reload commands causing deployment failure"
2. "fix: Remove rolling update config for single-instance environment"  
3. "fix: Remove wsgi user error for Docker deployment"

All changes have been pushed to the repository.

## Conclusion
The deployment configuration issues have been resolved. The remaining error appears to be related to the application/container startup rather than EB configuration. Further investigation of the Docker container logs and application environment is needed.
