## ðŸ”„ Manual Step Required: Vercel Authentication

The only remaining step is to authenticate with Vercel and deploy. Since your frontend is already built and configured:

### Option A: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Recommended)
```bash
cd frontend/pyfactor_next

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Option B: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Import your GitHub repository: `KuolDimDeng/projectx`
3. Set build directory to: `frontend/pyfactor_next`
4. Configure domains to point to: `www.dottapps.com`

## ðŸ“‹ Environment Variables for Vercel

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://dottapps-env.eba-3m4eq7bw.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://dottapps-env.eba-3m4eq7bw.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://dottapps-env.eba-3m4eq7bw.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
```
