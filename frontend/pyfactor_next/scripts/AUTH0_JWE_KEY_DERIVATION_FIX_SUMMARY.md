# Auth0 JWE Key Derivation Fix Summary

## Problem

After deploying the Auth0 JWE token and rate limiting fixes, the backend logs showed that JWE token validation was still failing. Specifically:

1. All attempted key derivation methods for the dir algorithm were failing to decrypt JWE tokens
2. The backend was falling back to Auth0 API validation, which was hitting rate limits
3. Users were experiencing 403 Forbidden errors when JWE tokens couldn't be validated

## Root Cause

The Auth0 JWE implementation uses the 'dir' algorithm with A256GCM encryption, but the key derivation method used by Auth0 is non-standard and not documented. The current implementation tries several standard approaches but none match Auth0's actual implementation.

## Solution

This fix adds several Auth0-specific key derivation methods that match those commonly used in Auth0 libraries:

1. PBKDF2 with salt derived from client_id
2. ConcatKDF with alg/enc as context
3. PKCS7 padding of the client secret
4. Direct use of client secret with specific Auth0 encoding schemes

By adding these methods and trying them first in the key derivation process, we significantly increase the chances of successful local JWE decryption.

## Implementation Details

- Added a new method `_derive_dir_key_using_auth0_methods` to the Auth0JWTAuthentication class
- Modified the `decrypt_jwe` method to try these Auth0-specific methods first
- Added detailed logging to track which key derivation method succeeds
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing key derivation methods

## Benefits

- Reduces Auth0 API rate limiting errors by improving local JWE decryption success rate
- Improves overall authentication performance by reducing external API calls
- Maintains fallback to Auth0 API validation for edge cases
- Adds more robust error handling and detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Testing

After deploying this fix, verify that:

1. JWE token validation succeeds without errors in the backend logs
2. No more "Auth0 API rate limit hit" errors appear in the logs 
3. Users can authenticate successfully without 403 Forbidden errors
4. The circuit breaker pattern is not triggered due to failed validations
