# Dashboard Rerendering Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-04-29
**Version:** 0003
**Issue:** Dashboard continuously rerendering after subscription completion

## Problem Overview

Users were experiencing an issue where after signing in and completing the subscription process (especially when selecting the Free Plan), the dashboard would enter an infinite rerendering loop. This was causing a poor user experience and preventing users from accessing the application dashboard.

The root cause was identified as a missing Cognito attribute setting. The `custom:onboarding` attribute was not being set to "complete" after the subscription process, causing the application to continuously check subscription status and redirect.

## Solution Implemented

We created a comprehensive solution with both frontend and backend components:

### Frontend Solution

1. **Dashboard Fix Script** (Version0003_fix_dashboard_cognito_onboarding.js):
   - Detects when users arrive at the dashboard with subscription URL parameters
   - Sets the `custom:onboarding` attribute to "complete" using AWS Amplify
   - Stores backup values in AppCache for resilience
   - Cleans up URL parameters to prevent reload loops
   - Handles edge cases and emergency fixes for rerender detection

2. **Injection Script** (Version0003_inject_dashboard_onboarding_fix.js):
   - Injects the fix script into the tenant dashboard page
   - Creates backups of modified files
   - Updates the script registry
   - Copies the fix script to the public directory for client-side loading

### Backend Solution

1. **Server-side Fix Script** (Version0003_fix_cognito_onboarding_attribute.py):
   - Provides utilities for managing Cognito attributes
   - Can fix users with missing `custom:onboarding` attributes
   - Implements proper error handling for Cognito operations
   - Includes logging for troubleshooting and verification

## Implementation Details

The solution addresses multiple aspects of the problem:

1. **Attribute Management:**
   - Safely updates Cognito attributes with proper error handling
   - Uses only allowed attributes as defined in the Cognito permissions
   - Falls back to AppCache when Cognito updates fail
   - Provides server-side utilities for bulk fixes

2. **Session Handling:**
   - Preserves authentication during the subscription-to-dashboard flow
   - Prevents unauthorized access or token expiration issues
   - Uses AWS Amplify v6 compliant authentication methods

3. **URL Management:**
   - Cleans up subscription parameters after successful processing
   - Uses history API to update URLs without page reloads
   - Preserves tenant context during navigation

4. **Rerender Detection:**
   - Tracks render count and time between renders
   - Provides emergency fix for detected rerender loops
   - Adds debugging information to help diagnose issues

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working correctly:

1. Complete the sign-in process and select the Free Plan on the subscription page
2. Confirm the dashboard loads without constantly reloading
3. Check browser network tab for no repeated dashboard page requests
4. Verify Cognito attributes show `custom:onboarding = complete`
5. Confirm the URL does not contain subscription parameters after loading
