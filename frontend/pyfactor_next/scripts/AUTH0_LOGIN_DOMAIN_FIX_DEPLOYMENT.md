# Auth0 Login Domain Handling Fix Deployment

## Issue
Users were experiencing 500 Internal Server Errors when accessing https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login.
The error was caused by inconsistent domain handling between different Auth0 route handlers.

## Root Cause
There were inconsistencies in how Auth0 domain URLs were constructed between the auth/login/route.js 
and auth/[...auth0]/route.js files. Specifically:

1. In [...auth0]/route.js, the URL was constructed as:
   https://{domain}/authorize?{params}

2. In login/route.js, a more complex normalization was used:
   const normalizeDomain = (domain) => {
     let normalizedDomain = domain.startsWith('http') ? domain : 'https://' + domain;
     normalizedDomain = normalizedDomain.endsWith('/') ? normalizedDomain.slice(0, -1) : normalizedDomain;
     return normalizedDomain;
   };
   const cleanDomainUrl = normalizeDomain(auth0Domain);
   const loginUrl = cleanDomainUrl + '/authorize?' + loginParams;

This inconsistency could lead to issues with domain handling, especially when dealing with 
custom domains like auth.dottapps.com.

## Fix
The solution standardizes the domain handling approach across both files by:
1. Removing any protocol prefix from the domain
2. Constructing the URL in the same format in both files
3. Adding improved validation and logging

This ensures that auth.dottapps.com will be properly handled in all cases.

## Deployment
This fix has been deployed to production. The changes made were minimal and focused
specifically on standardizing how domain URLs are constructed, without changing
any other business logic or authentication flows.

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login
2. The page should redirect to Auth0 login without a 500 error
3. Complete the login flow to ensure the entire authentication process works end-to-end

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, the previous version can be restored from the backup created during
the fix: frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/auth/login/route.js.backup_20250607
