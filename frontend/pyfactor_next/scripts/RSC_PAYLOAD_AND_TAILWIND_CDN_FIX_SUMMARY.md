# RSC Payload and Tailwind CDN Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Failed to fetch RSC payload for /api/auth/login
**Error**: `Failed to fetch RSC payload for https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login. Falling back to browser navigation.`

**Cause**: The `/api/auth/login` route was missing, causing Next.js to fail when trying to fetch the React Server Component payload.

**Solution**: Created a proper `/api/auth/login` route that:
- Constructs the Auth0 authorization URL with proper parameters
- Redirects users to Auth0 for authentication
- Handles both GET and POST requests

### 2. Tailwind CDN Warning in Production
**Warning**: `cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production.`

**Likely Cause**: This warning appears to be from a browser extension that injects Tailwind CDN scripts for development purposes. Common extensions that do this include:
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Web Developer extensions
- CSS/HTML live preview extensions

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **TailwindCDNBlocker Component**: Added a client-side component that:
   - Monitors DOM mutations for script/link injections
   - Removes any Tailwind CDN scripts in production
   - Logs warnings when CDN scripts are blocked

2. **Security Headers**: Created a utility for Content Security Policy that:
   - Restricts script sources to trusted domains only
   - Prevents unauthorized CDN injections
   - Maintains compatibility with Auth0, Stripe, and other services

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `/src/app/api/auth/login/route.js` - Proper login route handler
- `/src/components/TailwindCDNBlocker.js` - CDN blocking component
- `/src/utils/securityHeaders.js` - CSP headers utility

### Modified:
- `/src/app/layout.js` - Added TailwindCDNBlocker to root layout

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Login Flow**:
   ```bash
   # The login route should now properly redirect to Auth0
   curl -I https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login
   ```

2. **Check for CDN Scripts**:
   - Open browser DevTools
   - Go to Network tab
   - Filter by "tailwind" or "cdn"
   - Verify no CDN requests in production

3. **Browser Extension Check**:
   - Disable all browser extensions
   - Reload the page
   - Check if the Tailwind CDN warning disappears

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Ensure all changes are deployed to Vercel
2. **Monitor Console**: Check if RSC payload errors are resolved
3. **Review Extensions**: Consider documenting which browser extensions might cause CDN injection warnings

## Important Notes

- The Tailwind CDN warning is likely **not** from your application code
- Your project uses PostCSS with Tailwind properly configured for production
- The CDN blocker is a safeguard but the root cause is likely external (browser extension)
- The login route fix ensures proper Auth0 integration without infinite redirects
