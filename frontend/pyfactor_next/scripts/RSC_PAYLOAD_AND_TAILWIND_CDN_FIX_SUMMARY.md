# RSC Payload and Tailwind CDN Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Failed to fetch RSC payload
- **Error**: `Failed to fetch RSC payload for https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login`
- **Root Cause**: Next.js was treating auth routes as internal navigation with RSC, but they are actually external redirects
- **Fix**: Updated middleware and route handlers to add proper headers and force browser navigation

### 2. Tailwind CDN Warning
- **Warning**: `cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production`
- **Root Cause**: Either a browser extension or some code is loading Tailwind from CDN instead of using PostCSS/Tailwind CLI
- **Fix**: Added TailwindCDNBlocker component to detect and remove any CDN script tags

## Changes Made

### Middleware Updates
- Created/updated `middleware.js` to intercept auth routes
- Added proper cache control headers
- Set `x-middleware-rewrite` header to force browser navigation

### Auth Route Fixes
- Updated/created `/api/auth/login/route.js` with proper headers
- Added headers to `[...auth0]/route.js` responses
- Ensured redirects use browser navigation instead of client-side navigation

### Tailwind CDN Fix
- Created `TailwindCDNBlocker.js` component
- Added component to root layout
- Component uses MutationObserver to detect and remove any Tailwind CDN scripts

## Testing Notes
1. Navigate to /auth/signin or /api/auth/login
2. Should redirect to Auth0 without any console errors
3. Check browser console for absence of "Failed to fetch RSC payload" errors
4. Verify no Tailwind CDN warnings in production

## Next Steps
If you continue to see the Tailwind CDN warning:
1. Check browser extensions that might be injecting the CDN
2. Ensure no 3rd party scripts are loading Tailwind from CDN
3. Consider adding CSP headers to block unauthorized script sources
