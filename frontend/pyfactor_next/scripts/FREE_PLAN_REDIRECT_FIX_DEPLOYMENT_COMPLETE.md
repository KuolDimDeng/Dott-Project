# Free Plan Redirect Fix Deployment (Complete)

## Overview

This document summarizes the completed deployment of the fix for the free plan redirect issue, where users selecting the free plan during onboarding were redirected to the generic `/dashboard` URL instead of the tenant-specific `/tenant/{tenantId}/dashboard` URL.

## Deployment Details

**Date:** 2025-06-07

**Scripts Executed:**
- `Version0158_fix_free_plan_redirect.mjs` - Applied the core fixes
- `Version0159_commit_and_deploy_free_plan_redirect_fix.mjs` - Initial deployment attempt
- `Version0160_fix_commit_and_deploy_free_plan_redirect.mjs` - Fixed git paths and completed deployment

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Onboarding/SubscriptionForm.jsx` - Fixed the redirection logic
- `scripts/script_registry.md` - Updated script registry
- `scripts/FREE_PLAN_REDIRECT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Added documentation

**Branch Deployed To:** `Dott_Main_Dev_Deploy`

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the fix by:

1. Sign up for a new account
2. Select the Free plan during onboarding
3. Verify you are redirected to `/tenant/{tenantId}/dashboard` and not just `/dashboard`
4. Check browser console logs for the expected logging messages

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Added expiresDate definition**: Added a proper expiration date definition before setting cookies.

2. **Enhanced tenant ID retrieval**: Improved the tenant ID retrieval logic to:
   - Check Cognito attributes first (highest priority)
   - Then check AppCache
   - Then check localStorage
   - Include proper error handling and logging
   - Add debug logging for the redirection URL

3. **Fixed handleContinue function**: Ensured `expiresDate` is properly defined in the `handleContinue` function as well.

4. **Added enhanced logging**: Added more detailed logging to track the free plan selection process.

## Note on Deployment

The initial deployment script had incorrect file paths when trying to commit changes to git. This was fixed in the follow-up script (Version0160) with the correct relative paths.
