# Auth0 Edge Import Fix Summary

## Problem Description

A critical build failure was occurring during deployment with the following error:

```
Module not found: Package path ./edge is not exported from package /vercel/path0/frontend/pyfactor_next/node_modules/@auth0/nextjs-auth0
```

This error occurred because the application was trying to import from `@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge`, which is not exported in the current version of the Auth0 SDK installed in the project.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The Auth0 route handler (`src/app/api/auth/[...auth0]/route.js`) was importing the `withAuth0` middleware from the Edge Runtime version of the Auth0 SDK:
   ```javascript
   import { withAuth0 } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';
   ```

2. This import was likely added when upgrading to Next.js 15+, which has enhanced edge runtime capabilities.

3. However, the current version of the Auth0 SDK being used does not export the `/edge` path, causing the build failure.

## Solution

The solution was straightforward:

1. Remove the Edge Runtime import from the Auth0 route handler
2. Add a commented explanation for future developers
3. Keep the rest of the file's functionality intact

The specific change was:

```diff
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
- import { withAuth0 } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';
+ // Remove Edge Runtime import as it's not compatible with current Auth0 SDK version
+ // import { withAuth0 } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';
```

## Implementation

The fix was implemented through:

1. Script `Version0099_fix_auth0_edge_import.mjs` - Removes the incompatible import and adds documentation
2. Updated script registry to track the change

## Compatibility Notes

- This fix ensures compatibility with the current Auth0 SDK version
- It maintains all existing functionality while removing the problematic import
- For future upgrades that might use Edge Runtime features:
  - Either upgrade the Auth0 SDK to a version that supports Edge Runtime
  - Or explicitly implement Edge Runtime features without relying on the Auth0 SDK's edge support

## Testing

The fix was tested by:

1. Verifying the file modification was successful
2. Ensuring no functionality was lost with the removed import
3. Confirming the fix addresses the specific build error

## Environment Variables

This fix does not affect or depend on environment variables. The issue was purely related to package imports.

## Related to Auth0 Custom Domain

It's worth noting this issue is potentially related to the recent transition to using the Auth0 custom domain (`auth.dottapps.com`). The Auth0 setup now consistently uses this custom domain, which may have different compatibility requirements with the Auth0 SDK.

## Future Considerations

For future upgrades of the Next.js or Auth0 SDK:

1. If Edge Runtime features are needed, ensure the Auth0 SDK version supports them
2. Consider using a more recent Auth0 SDK that may have better Edge Runtime support
3. Alternatively, implement custom Edge Runtime handlers that don't depend on Auth0's Edge support

## Permanent Fix

This fix is considered permanent as it resolves the immediate build error. For enhanced Edge Runtime support in the future, a planned upgrade of the Auth0 SDK would be required.
