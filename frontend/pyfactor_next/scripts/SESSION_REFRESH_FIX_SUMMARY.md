# Session Refresh Fix Summary

## Issue
After completing onboarding, the user profile was still showing `needsOnboarding: true`, causing users to be redirected back to the onboarding flow even after successful completion.

## Root Causes
1. **Client-side navigation**: Using `router.push()` for navigation after onboarding completion was not forcing a full page reload, so the Auth0 session cookie wasn't being refreshed
2. **Stale session data**: The profile API was returning cached session data that hadn't been updated after onboarding completion
3. **Backend issuer mismatch**: Django backend was expecting "https://https://auth.dottapps.com//" (double protocol) instead of "https://auth.dottapps.com/"

## Fixes Applied

### 1. SimplifiedOnboardingForm.jsx (Line 178)
Changed from:
```javascript
router.push(result.redirect_url);
```

To:
```javascript
// Force a full page reload to refresh the session
// Using window.location.href instead of router.push to ensure session is refreshed
window.location.href = result.redirect_url;
```

This forces a full page reload, ensuring the Auth0 session cookie is re-read with the updated onboarding status.

### 2. Profile API Route (Already had cache control)
The profile API already includes cache control headers to prevent stale data:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Cache-Control': 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate',
  'Pragma': 'no-cache',
  'Expires': '0'
}
```

### 3. Complete-All API Route
The onboarding completion API properly updates the session with:
- `needsOnboarding: false`
- `onboardingCompleted: true`
- `currentStep: 'completed'`
- Tenant ID assignment
- Proper redirect URL: `/tenant/${tenantId}/dashboard`

### 4. Backend Auth0 Issuer Fix (Previously applied)
Fixed in `backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/auth0_authentication.py` to handle domains that already include "https://":
```python
if self.issuer_domain and self.issuer_domain.startswith("https://"):
    expected_issuer = self.issuer_domain.rstrip("/") + "/"
else:
    expected_issuer = f"https://{self.issuer_domain}/"
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Sign up as a new user** or use a test account that needs onboarding
2. **Complete the onboarding form** with all required information
3. **Verify the redirect** - should go to `/tenant/{tenantId}/dashboard` with a full page reload
4. **Check the profile data** - open browser console and check:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console after redirect
   fetch('/api/auth/profile').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
   // Should show: needsOnboarding: false, onboardingCompleted: true
   ```
5. **Refresh the page** - user should stay on dashboard, not redirect to onboarding

## What This Fixes

✅ User profile correctly shows `needsOnboarding: false` after onboarding
✅ No more redirect loops back to onboarding after completion
✅ Session data is properly refreshed after onboarding
✅ Django backend accepts Auth0 tokens without issuer errors
✅ Tenant ID is properly assigned and persisted

## Deployment

These changes are ready to deploy. After deployment:
1. Clear any browser caches/cookies from previous sessions
2. Test with a fresh user account
3. Monitor the logs for any session-related errors
