# Syntax Error Fix in EmployeeManagement.js

## Issue Description
A syntax error was introduced in the EmployeeManagement.js file during the user profile authentication fix
(Version0007_fix_user_profile_authentication_DashAppBar.js). The error was an unterminated string constant
in the logger statements, which appeared as:

```javascript
console.log('[UserProfile] Falling back to Cognito attributes 
    logger.debug('[EmployeeManagement] Auth error fetching profile, falling back to Cognito')');
```

This syntax error caused a build failure with the message: "Unterminated string constant".

## Fix Details
The fix separates the incorrectly concatenated logging statements into two separate statements:

```javascript
console.log('[UserProfile] Falling back to Cognito attributes');
logger.debug('[EmployeeManagement] Auth error fetching profile, falling back to Cognito');
```

## Technical Details
- Fixed unterminated string constant in console.log statement
- Fixed improper string concatenation syntax
- Separated logger.debug statement into its own line
- Maintained the original logging intent of both statements
