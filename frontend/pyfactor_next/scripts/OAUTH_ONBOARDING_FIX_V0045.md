# Google OAuth Onboarding Flow Fix - Version 0045

## Issue Summary
**Date:** 2025-05-29  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Fixed  

### Problem Description
Google OAuth users were successfully authenticating but not being directed to the onboarding flow. Instead, they were redirected to login with an "expired=true" parameter, indicating that the user creation and profile retrieval process was failing.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Backend Endpoints**: The `/api/users/profile` endpoint was returning 404 because it didn't exist in the Django backend
2. **No User Creation Flow**: OAuth users were not being created in the Django backend database
3. **Broken API Routes**: Frontend was calling non-existent endpoints after OAuth success
4. **Missing Authentication Logic**: OAuth success page lacked proper user creation and onboarding flow logic

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Backend API Endpoints (Fixed)
**File:** `backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/api/views/auth_views.py`

Created essential endpoints:
- `SignUpView` - Creates/verifies OAuth users in Django backend
- `UserProfileView` - Returns user profile information for authenticated users
- `VerifySessionView` - Validates user session
- `CheckUserAttributesView` - Returns user attributes
- `VerifyTenantView` - Handles tenant verification for users

**Key Features:**
- Handles OAuth user creation with `cognito_sub` field mapping
- Graceful error handling for existing users
- Proper tenant relationship management
- Returns standardized profile data structure

#### 2. URL Configuration (Fixed)
**File:** `backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/api/urls.py`

Added missing URL patterns:
```python
path('signup/', SignUpView.as_view(), name='user-signup'),
path('profile/', UserProfileView.as_view(), name='user-profile'),
```

#### 3. OAuth Success Page (Enhanced)
**File:** `frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/auth/oauth-success/page.js`

Completely rewritten with:
- Proper user account creation via backend API
- Robust error handling and fallbacks
- Correct onboarding flow redirection
- CognitoAttributes utility integration
- Debug information for development
- Multiple fallback strategies

**Flow Logic:**
1. Verify OAuth authentication tokens
2. Extract user info from Cognito
3. Create/verify user in backend via `/api/auth/signup/`
4. Fetch user profile via `/api/auth/profile/`
5. Redirect based on onboarding status:
   - Complete → Dashboard
   - Incomplete → Onboarding flow

### Technical Details

#### User Model Mapping
The Django User model uses different field names than expected:
- `cognito_sub` (not `cognito_id`)
- `role` (not `user_role`)
- Direct ID fields instead of relationship objects

#### API Endpoints Structure
```
/api/auth/signup/     - POST - Create OAuth user
/api/auth/profile/    - GET/PATCH - User profile operations
/api/auth/verify/     - POST - Credential verification
/api/auth/verify-session/ - GET - Session validation
```

#### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Primary**: Create user → Get profile → Redirect
2. **Fallback 1**: If signup fails, try direct profile fetch
3. **Fallback 2**: If all API calls fail, redirect to onboarding with error flags
4. **Ultimate Fallback**: Always redirect somewhere (never leave user stuck)

### Testing Validation

#### Expected Behavior After Fix:
1. User signs in with Google OAuth
2. User is redirected to `/auth/oauth-success`
3. Backend creates user account (if new) or verifies existing
4. User profile is retrieved from backend
5. User is redirected to:
   - `/onboarding?newUser=true&provider=google` (new users)
   - `/tenant/{tenantId}/dashboard` (existing completed users)

#### Debug Information
In development mode, the OAuth success page shows:
- User email
- Tenant ID extraction
- Custom attributes from Cognito
- API response data

### Configuration Requirements

#### Environment Variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://dott-env-fixed.eba-yek4sdqp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

#### Backend Settings
- Django User model with `cognito_sub` field
- Proper CORS configuration for API calls
- Authentication middleware for API endpoints

### Deployment Notes

#### Files Changed:
1. `backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/api/views/auth_views.py` - **Created/Enhanced**
2. `backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/api/urls.py` - **Updated**
3. `frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/auth/oauth-success/page.js` - **Rewritten**

#### Deployment Steps:
1. Deploy backend changes (new API endpoints)
2. Deploy frontend changes (enhanced OAuth success page)
3. Test OAuth flow end-to-end
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

### Known Limitations

1. **Email Verification**: OAuth users still show "Not verified" in Cognito console - this is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality
2. **Tenant Creation**: New OAuth users won't have tenants until they complete onboarding
3. **Onboarding Steps**: The onboarding flow may need updates to handle OAuth users properly

### Success Metrics

#### Before Fix:
- OAuth users redirected to login with `expired=true`
- 404 errors on `/api/users/profile`
- No user records created in Django backend

#### After Fix:
- OAuth users properly directed to onboarding
- User accounts created in Django backend
- Proper profile data retrieval
- Seamless onboarding flow initiation

### Monitoring & Maintenance

#### Log Monitoring:
- Django backend logs for user creation (`[SignUp:*]`)
- Frontend console logs for OAuth flow (`[OAuth Success]`)
- API response codes for profile endpoints

#### Performance Impact:
- Minimal - adds 2 API calls to OAuth flow
- Acceptable latency for user creation/verification
- Proper error handling prevents user frustration
