# previousView is null Error Fix

## Issue Description
After applying the user profile authentication fix, an error was occurring in the RenderMainContent component:
```
Error: previousView is null
```

This error occurred during view state cleanup when transitioning between views in the dashboard.

## Fix Details
The fix adds a null check before accessing properties on the `previousView` object in the `cleanupViewState` function. 
This prevents the error from occurring when `previousView` is null, which can happen in certain navigation scenarios.

## Technical Details
- Added a null check at the beginning of the `cleanupViewState` function to prevent errors when previousView is null
- Added a debug log when skipping cleanup due to null `previousView`
- Created a `safeCleanupViewState` wrapper function to handle cases where `cleanupViewState` might be called without parameters
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing view state management
