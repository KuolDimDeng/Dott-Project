# Next.js Configuration Final Fix

**Script:** Version0049_fix_nextjs_config_final.js  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-05-03  
**Status:** Ready for execution

## Issue Description

After applying previous fixes, the Next.js configuration file still has syntax errors. Instead of continuing with incremental fixes, a complete rewrite of the configuration file is needed to ensure correct syntax and structure.

## Root Cause Analysis

The previous incremental fixes introduced additional syntax errors in the Next.js configuration file:

1. There's an extra closing brace after the experimental section
2. The structure of the configuration object became malformed due to incremental changes

## Solution

This script takes a different approach by completely rewriting the Next.js configuration file to ensure correct syntax and eliminate all warnings:

1. Creates a clean, properly formatted configuration file with all necessary options
2. Includes proper experimental configuration with `serverActions` as an object
3. Removes all unrecognized properties
4. Maintains all essential configuration options for the project

## Execution Instructions

1. The script creates a backup of the current `next.config.js` file in the `/Users/kuoldeng/projectx/scripts/backups` directory
2. It then completely rewrites the configuration file with the correct syntax
3. Updates the script registry to track the execution

To apply the changes:

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/scripts

# Run the script
node Version0049_fix_nextjs_config_final.js

# Restart the Next.js development server
cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/frontend/pyfactor_next
pnpm run dev:https
```

## Verification

After running the script and restarting the Next.js server, verify that:

1. No syntax errors or configuration warnings appear during server startup
2. The home page loads correctly at https://localhost:3000
3. API proxy to the backend works properly
4. All Amplify and AWS functionality works as expected
5. The application functions normally with no regressions

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after applying this fix:

1. Copy the backup file back to the original location:
   ```bash
   cp /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/scripts/backups/next.config.js.backup-[timestamp] /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/frontend/pyfactor_next/next.config.js
   ```
2. Restart the Next.js development server
3. Report the issue with detailed information about what didn't work
