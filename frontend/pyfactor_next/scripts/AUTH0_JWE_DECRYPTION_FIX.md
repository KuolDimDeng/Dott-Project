# Auth0 JWE Token Decryption Fix

## Problem

After implementing the Auth0 login route fix, we observed that while the login redirection was working correctly, the backend was experiencing issues with JWE token decryption:

1. **JWE Token Validation Failures**: The logs showed errors like:
   ```
   ❌ JWE token validation failed: both local decryption and Auth0 API validation failed
   ```

2. **Rate Limit Issues**: The backend was hitting Auth0 API rate limits due to fallback to API validation:
   ```
   ❌ Auth0 API rate limit hit - OPENING ENHANCED CIRCUIT BREAKER
   ```

3. **403 Forbidden Errors**: As a result, API endpoints were returning 403 Forbidden errors due to authentication failures.

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive fix to ensure proper JWE token handling and decryption:

1. **Enhanced Auth0 Configuration**:
   - Added JWE optimization flags to ensure proper token handling
   - Implemented key derivation functions that match the backend implementation
   - Updated JWT handling for better token validation

2. **Key Derivation Consistency**:
   - Ensured the same key derivation approach is used in both frontend and backend
   - Added SHA-256 HKDF key derivation to match Auth0's implementation
   - Implemented proper secret handling for JWE token decryption

3. **Token Format Support**:
   - Enhanced support for JWE encrypted tokens
   - Added fallback mechanisms for different token formats
   - Implemented proper header parsing for token type detection

## Implementation

The script `Version0110_fix_auth0_jwe_token_decryption.mjs` makes these changes:

1. Updates Auth0 configuration in `src/config/auth0.js` to add JWE support
2. Adds key derivation functions to properly handle encrypted tokens
3. Updates environment variables to ensure consistent configuration
4. Creates a summary of the changes and deployment details

## Verification

After deploying these changes:

1. Login flow should work properly through auth.dottapps.com
2. Backend API endpoints should return 200 OK responses instead of 403 Forbidden
3. Logs should no longer show JWE token validation failures
4. The application should navigate through the onboarding flow without authentication errors

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Log out of the application
2. Log back in through the standard login flow
3. Verify successful navigation through onboarding
4. Check backend logs for any remaining token validation errors

## Important Notes

- JWE tokens are encrypted JWT tokens used by Auth0 for enhanced security
- Key derivation is critical for proper token validation
- This fix ensures consistency between frontend and backend token handling
