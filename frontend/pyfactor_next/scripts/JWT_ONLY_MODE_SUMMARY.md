# JWT-Only Authentication Mode

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to enforce JWT token use and disable JWE token validation in the authentication system.

## Problem

The application was experiencing several issues:
1. JWE token validation was failing with errors like "JWE token validation failed: both local decryption and Auth0 API validation failed"
2. Users were being redirected to onboarding after signing out and signing back in
3. Authentication with the backend API was failing, causing 403 Forbidden responses

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive fix with these key components:

### 1. Frontend Auth0 Configuration
- Added explicit flags to force JWT tokens: `useJwtAuth`, `disableJwe`, and `forceJwtToken`
- Enhanced logging to clearly indicate JWT-only mode is active
- Added detailed token type tracking for debugging

### 2. Backend Authentication
- Disabled JWE validation completely by setting `JWE_AVAILABLE = False`
- Modified the `validate_token` method to skip JWE validation and treat all tokens as JWT
- Added fallback mechanisms to maintain authentication when possible
- Improved token type detection to avoid false positives

### 3. Onboarding State Persistence
- Enhanced session handling for better reliability
- Added localStorage persistence for onboarding status
- Implemented multiple fallbacks for determining onboarding completion status
- Added comprehensive logging for easier troubleshooting

## Benefits

This solution provides:
- More reliable authentication by simplifying the token validation process
- Better user experience by preventing unnecessary onboarding redirects
- Improved error handling and logging for easier troubleshooting
- Multiple layers of persistence for critical user state

## Future Considerations

If JWE token support is needed in the future, a more comprehensive solution for JWE decryption should be implemented.
