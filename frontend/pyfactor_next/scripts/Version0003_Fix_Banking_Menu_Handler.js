/**
 * Script: Version0003_Fix_Banking_Menu_Handler.js
 * Date: 2025-04-28
 * 
 * Description:
 * This script documents the fix for the non-functioning Banking menu items by adding
 * the missing handleBankingClick handler function to the DashboardContent component.
 * 
 * Issue:
 * The Banking menu items (Connect to Bank, Bank Transactions, Bank Reconciliation, Reports)
 * are not working because the handleBankingClick function is passed as a prop but not
 * implemented in the DashboardContent component.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * Add the handleBankingClick function that maps menu values to the correct view states:
 * - 'dashboard' -> view = 'banking'
 * - 'connect' -> view = 'connect-bank'
 * - 'transactions' -> view = 'bank-transactions'
 * - 'reconciliation' -> view = 'bank-reconciliation'
 * - 'bank-reports' -> view = 'bank-report'
 * 
 * Implementation Details:
 * - Add the missing handleBankingClick function to DashboardContent.js
 * - No changes needed to the listItems.js as it already has the correct values
 * 
 * Files Modified:
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/components/Dashboard/DashboardContent.js
