# Backend Scripts Registry

This file tracks all scripts in the backend scripts directory, their purpose, and execution status.

## Backend Scripts

| Script Name | Purpose | Author | Date | Status | Last Execution |
|-------------|---------|--------|------|--------|----------------|
| No scripts executed yet | | | | | |

## Instructions for Execution

1. Navigate to the scripts directory: `cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor/scripts`
2. Activate the virtual environment if needed: `source ../../../.venv/bin/activate`
3. Run the script: `python <script_name>.py`
4. After execution, update the Status and Last Execution columns in this registry

## Notes on Script Design

- All scripts should include a version number in the filename
- Scripts should create backups before modifying files
- Scripts should have comprehensive documentation within the file
- Scripts should log all operations they perform
- Scripts should have error handling to prevent partial/broken changes
- For database operations, scripts should implement transaction rollback capabilities

## Backend Script Registry

This file tracks all backend scripts that have been executed in the system.

|----------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Version0001_add_page_privileges_model | Add UserPagePrivilege model for page-level access control | 2023-06-25T14:30:00Z | Completed |

## Future Scripts

We may need to create the following backend scripts to support the page-level access control feature:

1. A script to create the necessary database schema updates (if needed)
2. A script to implement the API endpoint for retrieving user page privileges

## Script Development Guidelines

1. Use the versioning convention: `Version####_Description.py`
2. Include comprehensive documentation within the script
3. Always create backups before modifying files
4. Add error handling and logging
5. Update this registry after creating a new script
