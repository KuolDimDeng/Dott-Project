# Version0014_FixShowAddFormReferences_EmployeeManagement

## Issue Description
This script addresses the persistent error in the Employee Management component:

```
ReferenceError: showAddForm is not defined
```

The error occurs because there are still references to `showAddForm` in the component after implementing the tabbed interface, but the `showAddForm` state variable is either not defined or not properly initialized.

### Root Cause
1. When implementing the tabbed interface, we replaced the `showAddForm` state with the `employeeTab` state
2. However, not all references to `showAddForm` were updated to use the new state variable
3. This causes the component to fail when it tries to access the undefined `showAddForm` variable

### Fix Applied
The script makes the following changes:

1. Replaces all onClick handlers that use `showAddForm` with equivalent handlers using `employeeTab`
2. Updates conditional rendering that depends on `showAddForm` to use `employeeTab === 'add'` instead
3. Replaces all other direct references to `showAddForm` with the equivalent check `employeeTab === 'add'`
4. Updates all calls to `setShowAddForm(true)` with `setEmployeeTab('add')`
5. Updates all calls to `setShowAddForm(false)` with `setEmployeeTab('list')`

## Implementation Details

### Changes to EmployeeManagement.js
- Systematically replaced all references to the old state variable with the new one
- Maintained the same functionality but using the new tabbed interface state
- Fixed conditional rendering that was causing the component to fail

### Technical Approach
- Created a backup of the original file before making changes
- Used regular expressions to find and replace all instances of the problematic code
- Ensured consistent state management throughout the component
