# EmployeeManagement Component ChunkLoadError Fix

## Issue Description

The Employee Management page is failing to load with the following error:

```
[RenderMainContent] Error loading EmployeeManagement component: ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk _app-pages-browser_src_app_dashboard_components_forms_EmployeeManagement_js failed.
(missing: https://localhost:3000/_next/static/chunks/_app-pages-browser_src_app_dashboard_components_forms_EmployeeManagement_js.js)
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurs due to a discrepancy between the component file paths in the project. The application has duplicate versions of the `EmployeeManagement.js` component in two locations:

1. `/Users/kuoldeng/projectx/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/components/forms/EmployeeManagement.js` (newer version)
2. `/Users/kuoldeng/projectx/src/app/dashboard/components/forms/EmployeeManagement.js` (older version)

Next.js is attempting to load the component from the correct path but the chunk loader is looking at a different location, causing the chunk loading error.

This happens when:

- The component is lazy-loaded with `React.lazy()` or the enhanced lazy loader in RenderMainContent.js
- The component has been modified in one location but not the other
- The Next.js build process is using a cached version that doesn't match the actual file

## Solution

The fix script (`Version0001_Fix_EmployeeManagement_Component_Loading.js`) does the following:

1. Creates a backup of the current file in the source directory
2. Copies the working version from the frontend directory to the src directory
3. Clears any Next.js chunks cache related to the EmployeeManagement component
4. Provides instructions to restart the Next.js server

## How to Run the Fix

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/scripts/Version0001_Fix_EmployeeManagement_Component_Loading.js

# Run the script
node /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/scripts/Version0001_Fix_EmployeeManagement_Component_Loading.js

# Restart the Next.js server
pnpm run dev:https
```

## Prevention Measures

To prevent this issue from happening again:

1. **File Structure Consistency**: Ensure components are only defined in one location in the project, not duplicated across directories
2. **Build Process Improvement**: Update the build process to detect and warn about duplicate component definitions
3. **Component Registry**: Consider implementing a centralized component registry that clearly defines the source of truth for each component
4. **Synchronization Script**: Create a script that runs as part of the build process to ensure component files are properly synchronized

## Technical Details

- **Next.js Version**: 15
- **Component Loading Method**: Using enhanced lazy loading with error boundaries
- **File Structure**: Component files exist in parallel directories (projectx/src and projectx/frontend/pyfactor_next/src)
- **Error Type**: ChunkLoadError in dynamic imports
