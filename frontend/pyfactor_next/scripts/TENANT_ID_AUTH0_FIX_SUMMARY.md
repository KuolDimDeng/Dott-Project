# Auth0 Tenant ID Session Fix

## Problem Description

Users with existing tenant IDs were not having their tenant IDs properly set in the Auth0 session. This resulted in several issues:

1. The Auth0 callback was not getting the tenant ID properly, causing users to be treated as new users
2. The needsOnboarding and onboardingCompleted flags were not being properly set or were inconsistent
3. Users were being redirected to onboarding even if they had completed it before

The logs showed that although a user had a tenant ID in the database, it wasn't being properly passed to the frontend during authentication, resulting in `undefined` values and conflicting status flags.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was occurring in the Auth0 user creation/lookup API endpoint. When an existing user was found in the database, the response included the tenant ID, but it wasn't:

1. Consistently using both `tenant_id` and `tenantId` fields (some parts of the code expected one, other parts expected the other)
2. Updating the Auth0 session cookie with the tenant ID information
3. Setting backup tenant ID cookies for additional persistence

## Solution

The fix modifies the create-auth0-user API route to:

1. Return both `tenant_id` and `tenantId` fields for consistency
2. Update the Auth0 session cookie with the correct tenant ID and onboarding status
3. Set additional tenant ID cookies for persistent storage and future lookups
4. Ensure consistent handling of onboarding status flags

This ensures that when an existing user logs in, their tenant ID is properly preserved in all required locations, preventing the system from treating them as new users or directing them to onboarding unnecessarily.

## Implementation Details

The changes were focused on the `/app/api/user/create-auth0-user/route.js` file, specifically improving the handling of existing users by returning a more complete response that includes session cookie updates.

## Deployed Changes

- Modified `frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/user/create-auth0-user/route.js` to improve tenant ID handling
- Created a backup of the original file
- Updated the script registry
