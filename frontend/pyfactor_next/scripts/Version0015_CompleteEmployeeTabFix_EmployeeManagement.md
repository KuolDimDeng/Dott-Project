# Version0015_CompleteEmployeeTabFix_EmployeeManagement

## Issue Description
This script provides a comprehensive fix for the Employee Management component, addressing the persistent errors:

```
ReferenceError: employeeTab is not defined
```

After our previous fixes, we're still encountering issues with the state variables in the component. This indicates that our previous fixes were incomplete or that there are deeper structural issues with how the state is being managed.

### Root Cause
1. The state variable declarations in the component are inconsistent or incomplete
2. There might be scope issues with how the state variables are being accessed
3. The conditional rendering logic is not properly implemented
4. String quotes are inconsistent (mixing single and double quotes)

### Fix Applied
The script makes the following comprehensive changes:

1. **Complete State Reset**: Replaces the entire state declaration section with a clean, complete set of state variables
   - Ensures `employeeTab` and `setEmployeeTab` are properly declared
   - Includes all necessary state variables for the component to function
   - Initializes state variables with appropriate default values

2. **Tab Navigation Fix**: Replaces the tab navigation section with a clean implementation
   - Uses consistent string quotes (double quotes)
   - Properly handles tab switching
   - Resets the new employee form when switching to the add tab

3. **Conditional Rendering Fix**: Updates all conditional rendering logic
   - Ensures consistent string quotes in comparisons
   - Fixes the main content conditional rendering
   - Properly structures the tab content

## Implementation Details

### Changes to EmployeeManagement.js
- Completely rewrote the state declaration section
- Fixed the tab navigation implementation
- Updated conditional rendering throughout the component
- Ensured consistent string quotes for state values

### Technical Approach
- Created a backup of the original file before making changes
- Used a structured approach to identify and fix specific sections of the component
- Ensured all state variables are properly declared and initialized
- Fixed string quote consistency issues
