# Version0012_FixMissingStateVariables_EmployeeManagement

## Issue Description
This script addresses multiple reference errors in the EmployeeManagement component after implementing the tabbed interface. The main error was:

```
ReferenceError: showAddForm is not defined
```

The error occurred because several state variables were missing or incorrectly modified during the implementation of the tabbed interface. Additionally, there were conflicts between the `activeTab` and `activeSection` state variables.

### Root Cause
1. The `showAddForm` state variable was referenced in the component but was not defined
2. Several other state variables were accidentally removed during the implementation
3. There was confusion between the original `activeTab` state (for section navigation) and the new tab state for employee management tabs

### Fix Applied
The script makes the following changes:

1. Restores missing state variables:
   - `showAddForm` and `setShowAddForm`
   - `showEditForm` and `setShowEditForm`
   - `selectedEmployee` and `setSelectedEmployee`
   - `isEditing` and `setIsEditing`

2. Renames state variables to avoid conflicts:
   - Keeps `activeTab` for the original section navigation ('employee-management' or 'personal')
   - Creates `employeeTab` for the new employee management tabs ('list' or 'add')

3. Updates all references to these state variables throughout the component

## Implementation Details

### Changes to EmployeeManagement.js
- Added back missing state variable declarations
- Renamed the new tab state to `employeeTab` to avoid conflicts
- Updated all references to these state variables throughout the component
- Fixed button click handlers that were using undefined variables

### Technical Approach
- Maintained the original functionality of both the section navigation and the new employee tabs
- Ensured all state variables are properly defined before being referenced
- Used search and replace to systematically update all references
