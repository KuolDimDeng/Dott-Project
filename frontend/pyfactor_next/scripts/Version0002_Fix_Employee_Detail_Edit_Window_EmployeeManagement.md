# Employee Detail and Edit Window Fix (Version 2)

## Issue Description
When a user clicks on the edit button for an employee in the list, the detail window still appears behind the edit window, causing a confusing user experience.

## Root Cause
After further investigation, we found two issues:
1. The `renderEmployeeDetailsDialog` function only checks if `selectedEmployee` exists, but doesn't check if `showEmployeeDetails` is true
2. The `handleEditEmployee` function sets `selectedEmployee` even when editing directly from the list, which causes the details dialog to render in the background

## Fix Implementation
The fix modifies the `EmployeeManagement.js` file to ensure that:
1. The `renderEmployeeDetailsDialog` function checks both `selectedEmployee` AND `showEmployeeDetails` before rendering
2. The `handleEditEmployee` function doesn't set `selectedEmployee` when editing directly from the list
