# Auth0 Login Route 500 Error Fix Deployment

## Problem
The Auth0 login route (api/auth/login) was returning a 500 error due to:
1. Variable scope issues in the error handling block
2. Domain consistency issues between Auth0 configuration and the login route
3. Improper error handling when environmental variables are not available

## Solution
This script commits and deploys the fixes implemented in Version0149_fix_auth0_login_route_domain_issue.mjs:
1. Properly scoped variables to ensure they're available in the catch block
2. Ensured consistent domain usage with the Auth0 custom domain (auth.dottapps.com)
3. Improved error handling to provide better diagnostic information
4. Added additional validation to prevent errors during initialization

## Deployment Process
1. Commit the changes to the Auth0 login route
2. Push to the Dott_Main_Dev_Deploy branch to trigger deployment
3. Verify the changes in production

## Verification Steps
After deployment, users should be able to:
1. Access the login page without encountering 500 errors
2. Successfully authenticate with Auth0
3. Be redirected to the appropriate callback URL
