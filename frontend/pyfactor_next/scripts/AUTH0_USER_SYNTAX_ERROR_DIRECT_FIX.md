# Auth0 User Route Syntax Error Direct Fix

## Issue Summary
The Vercel build was still failing with syntax errors in the create-auth0-user route after the previous fix attempt:

```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The previous fix attempt didn't properly address the syntax issues
2. There was a missing semicolon before the catch block at line 181
3. The if-else structure at lines 186-187 was fundamentally broken and needed complete restructuring

## Solution Implemented
1. Added a semicolon after the closing brace at line 180, properly terminating the statement before the catch block
2. Completely rewrote the problematic conditional logic at lines 185-190, replacing it with a properly structured if statement
3. Removed the problematic else clause entirely, simplifying the logic flow
4. Created a backup of the original file for reference

## Testing and Verification
The fix was tested by:
1. Directly examining the syntax structure against JavaScript parsing rules
2. Deploying to Vercel to verify that the build process completes successfully

## Deployment
The fix is deployed to production via the Vercel deployment pipeline.

## Monitoring
Continue to monitor the Vercel build logs for any further syntax or runtime errors.
