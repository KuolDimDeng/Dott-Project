# Authentication and Session Management Fixes

**Issue ID:** AUTH-FIX-2025-06-01  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Date:** 2025-06-01

## Overview

This document describes the authentication and session management fixes implemented to address issues with the sign-in to dashboard flow. The primary goal was to make the authentication flow more resilient, handle errors gracefully, and ensure a smooth user experience.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Session Timeout Issues
- Loading timeouts in the `useSession` hook were causing premature session loading failures
- Users were experiencing "Global loading timeout reached" errors
- Session state was inconsistent between components

### 2. Error Handling
- Auth configuration errors weren't properly handled, leading to "UserPool not configured" messages
- No graceful fallbacks were in place when session loading failed
- Multiple redundant log messages in the DashAppBar component

### 3. Source Map Configuration
- Source map errors were making it difficult to debug JavaScript issues
- Missing source map configuration in the Next.js build

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Session Management Improvements
- Increased `LOADING_TIMEOUT` from 10s to 20s to allow more time for session loading
- Reduced `MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL` from 30s to 20s for more responsive refreshes
- Added better fallback mechanisms when session loading fails
- Implemented a partial session flag to indicate when using fallback data

### 2. Enhanced Caching
- Improved attribute caching to use both sessionStorage and APP_CACHE
- Added cross-component resilience with backup data sources
- Added timestamp tracking to use the most recent cached data

### 3. DashAppBar Fixes
- Removed duplicate log messages that were cluttering the console
- Added better business name resolution with a fallback to "My Business" if no name is found
- Improved logging to identify the source of business name data

### 4. Amplify Configuration Stability
- Increased retry attempts for authentication operations from 2 to 3
- Added specialized handling for network errors with longer retry intervals
- Improved error recovery for "UserPool not configured" errors

### 5. Source Map Configuration
- Added `productionBrowserSourceMaps: true` to Next.js configuration
- Created a dedicated script for source map configuration updates

## Testing Instructions

1. Test the sign-in flow from start to dashboard to ensure a smooth transition
2. Test session persistence across page refreshes
3. Test error recovery by:
   - Temporarily disabling network connection during session loading
   - Refreshing the page during authentication
   - Navigating between authenticated and unauthenticated routes

## Deployment Notes

The fixes are implemented through two scripts:
1. `auth_session_fix.js` - Main script that applies all authentication and session fixes
2. `source_map_fix.js` - Optional script to enable source maps for better debugging

Run the main script with:
```
node scripts/auth_session_fix.js
```

Run the source map fix with:
```
node scripts/source_map_fix.js
```

## Verification

After applying the fixes, verify that:
1. No "Global loading timeout reached" errors appear in the console
2. The business name appears correctly in the Dashboard AppBar
3. Session information persists correctly when navigating between pages
4. Proper error handling occurs when network issues happen
