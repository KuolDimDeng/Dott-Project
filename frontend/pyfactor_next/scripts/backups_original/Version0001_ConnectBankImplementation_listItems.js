/**
 * Script: Version0001_ConnectBankImplementation_listItems.js
 * Date: 2025-04-28
 * 
 * Description:
 * This script documents the implementation of the "Connect to Bank" functionality
 * in the Banking menu of the dashboard. The implementation includes:
 * 
 * 1. Creating the ConnectBankManagement component with region-based bank connection support
 * 2. Setting up necessary Next.js page routes for the banking section
 * 3. Updating the ConnectBank component to work with business country detection
 * 4. Fixing linter errors in banking models
 * 
 * Implementation Details:
 * - Page structure follows Next.js app directory pattern
 * - Banking integration leverages existing Plaid service
 * - Added support for regional providers: PayStack, dLocal, etc.
 * - Automatically detects business location using Cognito attributes
 * 
 * Files Modified:
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/components/forms/ConnectBankManagement.js (Created)
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/components/forms/ConnectBank.js (Updated)
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/banking/connect/page.js (Created)
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/banking/page.js (Created)
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/banking/layout.js (Created)
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/banking/transactions/page.js (Created)
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/banking/reconciliation/page.js (Created)
 * - /frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/banking/bank-reports/page.js (Created)
 * - /backend/pyfactor/banking/models.py (Fixed linter errors)
 * 
 * No changes were required to the listItems.js file as it already contained
 * the "Connect to Bank" menu item with the correct value ("connect") that
 * now routes to the new ConnectBankManagement component.
