# Employee Portal Tab Restructuring

## Overview
This script restructures the Employee Portal tabs to improve user experience and organization. The changes include:

1. Splitting the "Employee Management" tab into two separate tabs:
   - "Add Employee"
   - "List Employees"

2. Reordering tabs so that "Personal Information" appears first, followed by "Add Employee" and "List Employees"

3. Ensuring proper tab navigation and content display

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/components/forms/EmployeeManagement.js`

### Changes Made

1. **State Management**:
   - Replaced `activeTab` state with `mainTab` state
   - Set default tab to 'personal'
   - Maintained `employeeTab` state for backward compatibility
   - Updated state initialization

2. **Tab UI Structure**:
   - Reorganized tab order: Personal Information, Add Employee, List Employees
   - Updated tab selection styling and click handlers
   - Removed the separate "Add Employee" button since it's now a dedicated tab

3. **Content Rendering**:
   - Updated conditional rendering logic to display appropriate content based on selected tab
   - Ensured the Add Employee form appears when the Add Employee tab is selected
   - Maintained the employee list view for the List Employees tab
   - Preserved the Personal Information tab functionality

4. **Navigation Logic**:
   - Updated all references to the old tab structure
   - Ensured proper state transitions between tabs
   - Maintained form reset functionality when switching to Add Employee tab

## Technical Notes

- The script creates a backup of the original file before making changes
- Backward compatibility is maintained for any code that might reference the old state variables
- The implementation uses Tailwind CSS for styling, as per project requirements
- No changes were made to the backend or data handling logic

## Version History

- v1.0 (2025-04-25): Initial implementation

1. All three tabs are visible and in the correct order
2. Clicking each tab displays the appropriate content
3. The Add Employee form works correctly
4. The employee list displays and functions properly
5. The Personal Information tab works as expected
6. No regressions in existing functionality
