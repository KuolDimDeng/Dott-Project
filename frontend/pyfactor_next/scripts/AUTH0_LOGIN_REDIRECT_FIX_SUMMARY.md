# Auth0 Login Redirect Fix

## Issue Summary
A critical issue was identified in the Auth0 login flow, causing a 500 Internal Server Error. The problem was occurring in the `/api/auth/login/route.js` file where an infinite redirect loop was created due to the route redirecting to itself rather than to the Auth0 authorization endpoint.

```javascript
// Problematic code that caused the infinite redirect loop
const authUrl = new URL('/api/auth/login', request.url);
```

This code was creating a URL that pointed back to the same endpoint, causing the browser to enter an infinite redirect loop which eventually resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Fix Implementation

The fix was implemented in `Version0096_fix_auth_login_infinite_redirect.mjs` and involved changing the login route to properly redirect to the Auth0 authorization endpoint instead of back to itself:

```javascript
// Fixed code that properly redirects to Auth0
const authUrl = `https://${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/authorize?` + 
  new URLSearchParams({
    response_type: 'code',
    client_id: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
    redirect_uri: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/api/auth/callback`,
    scope: 'openid profile email',
    audience: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE || 'https://api.dottapps.com',
  });
```

This properly constructs a URL to the Auth0 authorization endpoint with all necessary parameters, ensuring that users are redirected to Auth0 for authentication rather than causing an infinite loop.

## Environment Variables

The fix relies on the following environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN`: Set to "auth.dottapps.com" (custom domain for Auth0)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: Auth0 client ID for the application
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Base URL of the application (https://dottapps.com)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE`: Auth0 audience value (default: https://api.dottapps.com)

## Testing

The fix was tested to ensure that:
1. The login route properly redirects to Auth0
2. No infinite redirect loops occur
3. Authentication flow completes successfully
4. RSC payload fetch errors are prevented through proper cache-control headers

## Related Fixes

This fix works in conjunction with other recent Auth0 improvements:

1. `Version0094_add_withAuth0_import.mjs` - Added withAuth0 import to Auth0 route handler
2. `Version0095_fix_auth_login_redirect.mjs` - Fixed redirect inconsistencies in Auth0 login

## Impact

This fix resolves the 500 Internal Server Error that was occurring during login attempts, which was preventing users from accessing the application. This is a critical fix that restores the core authentication functionality of the application.

## Deployment Notes

The fix has been deployed to production and should take immediate effect. No configuration changes or environment variable updates are required as the fix uses existing environment variables.
