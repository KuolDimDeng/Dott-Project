# Version0010_AddEmployeeTabs_EmployeeManagement

## Overview
This script enhances the Employee Management component by adding two tabs:
1. **List Employees** - A dedicated tab for viewing and managing the list of employees
2. **Add Employee** - A dedicated tab for adding new employees

This implementation improves the user experience by separating the employee management functionality into logical sections while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Changes to EmployeeManagement.js
- Added a new state variable `activeTab` to track the currently active tab ('list' or 'add')
- Created a tabbed interface in the component header with two tab buttons
- Reorganized the existing employee management functionality into two separate tab panels:
  - **List Employees tab**: Contains the employee directory, search functionality, and actions
  - **Add Employee tab**: Contains the form for adding new employees
- Maintained all existing functionality including:
  - Employee search and filtering
  - Employee creation
  - Employee editing
  - Employee deletion
  - Employee details viewing
- Added tab switching logic to navigate between tabs
- Ensured consistent styling with the rest of the application using Tailwind CSS

### UI Components
- **Tab Navigation**: Implemented using buttons with conditional styling based on the active tab
- **Tab Content**: Conditionally rendered based on the active tab state
- **Add Employee Button**: Added in the List Employees tab that switches to the Add Employee tab
- **Refresh Button**: Maintained in the List Employees tab to refresh the employee list

### Technical Approach
- Used React state to manage the active tab
- Implemented conditional rendering for tab content
- Maintained existing component state and functions
- Used Tailwind CSS for styling to match the application's design system
- Ensured the implementation follows ES modules syntax
- Maintained strict tenant isolation in all operations

## Security Considerations
- No changes were made to the authentication or authorization logic
- Tenant isolation is maintained through the existing implementation
- No hardcoded tenant IDs or sensitive information were added
- All API calls maintain their existing security measures

## Execution
