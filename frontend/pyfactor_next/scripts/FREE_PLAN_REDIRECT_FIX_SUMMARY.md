# Free Plan Redirect Fix Summary

## Issue
When selecting the Free plan in the subscription form, users were being redirected to the generic `/dashboard` URL instead of the tenant-specific `/tenant/{tenantId}/dashboard` URL.

## Root Causes

1. **Missing expiresDate definition**: The `handleFreePlanSelection` function was attempting to use `expiresDate` to set cookie expiration, but this variable was not defined, causing a JavaScript error.

2. **Incomplete Tenant ID retrieval logic**: The tenant ID retrieval logic wasn't comprehensive enough, only checking Cognito attributes and AppCache, but not properly falling back to localStorage.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Added expiresDate definition**: Added a proper expiration date definition before setting cookies.

2. **Enhanced tenant ID retrieval**: Improved the tenant ID retrieval logic to:
   - Check Cognito attributes first (highest priority)
   - Then check AppCache
   - Then check localStorage
   - Include proper error handling and logging
   - Add debug logging for the redirection URL

3. **Fixed handleContinue function**: Ensured `expiresDate` is properly defined in the `handleContinue` function as well.

4. **Added enhanced logging**: Added more detailed logging to track the free plan selection process.

## Impact

This fix ensures that users selecting the Free plan will be properly redirected to their tenant-specific dashboard, maintaining a consistent user experience and preventing potential data access issues.

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Sign up for a new account
2. Select the Free plan during onboarding
3. Verify you are redirected to `/tenant/{tenantId}/dashboard` and not just `/dashboard`
4. Check browser console logs for the expected logging messages
