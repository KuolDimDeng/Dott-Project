# Consolidate Employee Actions in EmployeeManagement Component

## Issue Description
The EmployeeManagement component has multiple code paths for the same actions (edit, view, delete), which causes confusion and leads to bugs like the detail window appearing behind the edit window.

## Root Cause
After thorough investigation, we found that:
1. There are multiple ways to trigger the edit functionality (from the list and from the details dialog)
2. These different paths use different state management approaches
3. The view/details functionality doesn't properly clean up when switching to edit mode
4. The renderEmployeeDetailsDialog function only checks if selectedEmployee exists, not if showEmployeeDetails is true

## Fix Implementation
The fix modifies the EmployeeManagement.js file to:
1. Consolidate all edit functionality into a single handleEditEmployee function
2. Create a dedicated handleViewEmployeeDetails function for viewing details
3. Ensure the handleCloseEmployeeDetails function properly cleans up all state
4. Update the renderEmployeeDetailsDialog function to check both selectedEmployee AND showEmployeeDetails
5. Update all UI components to use these consolidated functions
