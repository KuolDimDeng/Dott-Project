# RSC Payload Error Fix Summary

## Problem
- Next.js was trying to fetch React Server Component payload for auth API routes
- This caused "Failed to fetch RSC payload" errors when navigating to /api/auth/login
- The issue occurs because Next.js treats these as internal navigation instead of external redirects

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Middleware (src/middleware.js)
- Intercepts requests to /api/auth/* routes
- Adds headers to prevent RSC payload fetching
- Forces browser navigation for auth routes

### 2. Updated Auth Route Handler
- Added Cache-Control headers to prevent caching
- Added x-middleware-rewrite header to signal external navigation
- Ensures proper redirect responses

## Key Changes

### Middleware Configuration
- Matches all routes except static files
- Special handling for /api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/callback
- Prevents Next.js from treating these as internal navigation

### Auth Route Headers
```javascript
const response = NextResponse.redirect(loginUrl);
response.headers.set('x-middleware-rewrite', request.url);
response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate');
```

## Testing
1. Navigate to /auth/signin
2. Should redirect to Auth0 without RSC payload errors
3. Check browser console for absence of "Failed to fetch RSC payload" errors
