## Overview

- Dashboard header with navigation
- Side drawer with menu items
- Main content area for displaying various dashboard screens

## Recent Changes

### 2023-11-28: Fixed ensureAuthProvider reference error

A reference error was occurring because the component was trying to use the `ensureAuthProvider` function without importing it first. This function is used to ensure that the authentication provider is properly set in the APP_CACHE.

Changes made:
- Added import for ensureAuthProvider from @/utils/refreshUserSession

## Key Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Collapsible side drawer navigation
- Centralized error handling with ErrorBoundary
- Dynamic content rendering based on navigation state
- Authentication status verification

## Component Hierarchy

- Dashboard (Container)
  - NotificationProvider
  - ToastProvider
  - ErrorBoundary
  - DashboardContent (Memoized for performance)
    - DashAppBar (Header navigation)
    - Drawer (Side navigation)
    - RenderMainContent (Dynamic content area)

## Authentication

The component performs an authentication check on initialization:
- It ensures the APP_CACHE has the proper authentication provider set
- It verifies the user's session is valid
- It handles authentication errors gracefully

## Usage

This component is the main wrapper for all dashboard screens and should not be used directly. Instead, use the exported Dashboard component which properly sets up all providers and error boundaries.
