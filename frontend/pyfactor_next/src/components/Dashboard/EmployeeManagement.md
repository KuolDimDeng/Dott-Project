# Employee Management Component

## Overview
The Employee Management component provides a comprehensive interface for managing employees within the HR section of the application. This component is designed to handle employee data separately from User Management.

## Implementation Details

### Navigation
The Employee Management component is accessed from the HR menu, specifically through the "Employees" option. It's important to note that Employee Management and User Management are distinct features in the application:

- **Employee Management**: Manages employee records, including job titles, departments, salaries, etc.
- **User Management**: Manages user accounts and access to the application (found in Settings)

### Issue Resolution: HR Employees Menu Option
A fix was implemented to ensure that clicking the "Employees" option in the HR menu correctly loads the Employee Management component instead of the User Management component.

#### Fix Details:
1. The `handleEmployeeManagementClick` function in `DashboardContent.js` was verified to correctly set:
   - `showEmployeeManagement: true`
   - `showHRDashboard: false`
   - `hrSection: 'employees'`

2. In `RenderMainContent.js`, the rendering logic was updated to:
   - Check for `showEmployeeManagement: true` before checking for Settings components
   - Prioritize rendering of EmployeeManagement component when HR Employees is selected
   - Prevent the SettingsManagement component from being rendered when viewing Employee Management

3. Fixed a reference error in `RenderMainContent.js` where:
   - The variable `sectionComponentKey` was being used before it was initialized
   - The declaration of `sectionComponentKey` was moved earlier in the function to ensure it's available
   - Used a specific component key format `employee-management-${navigationKey || 'default'}` instead of the generic one

This ensures that when a user clicks on "Employees" in the HR menu, the system renders the Employee Management component rather than the User Management component from the Settings section.

### Component Structure
- The Employee Management component displays a list of employees
- Provides functionality for adding, editing, and viewing detailed employee information
- Displays employee details including name, email, job title, department, and role
- Includes filtering and searching capabilities

### API Integration
