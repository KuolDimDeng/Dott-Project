# Onboarding Redirect Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

After signing up and signing in as a new user, the application was not properly redirecting users to the onboarding business info page. Instead, they would be redirected back to the sign-in page. The console logs showed:

1. Authentication was successful: `[SignInForm] Sign-in result Object { isSignedIn: true, nextStep: "DONE" }`
2. The system attempted to redirect to onboarding: `[SignInForm] No onboarding status, redirecting to onboarding`
3. Session refresh failed: `[OnboardingLayout] Failed to refresh session, tokens not returned`
4. User got redirected back to signin: `[OnboardingLayout] Refresh failed, redirecting to signin`

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by inconsistent token storage and retrieval mechanisms across different parts of the application:

1. The authentication tokens were primarily stored in `window.__APP_CACHE` but this wasn't consistently used or checked
2. When the OnboardingLayout component loaded, it couldn't find the tokens through its normal retrieval path
3. Despite tokens being successfully generated during authentication, they weren't being properly persisted or accessed
4. The onboarding routes had strict authentication checks, causing a redirect loop

## Solution

We implemented a fix (`Version0001_fix_onboarding_redirect_issue.js`) with the following changes:

1. **Enhanced Token Storage**: Updated the SignInForm component to store tokens in multiple locations:
   - Added consistent storage in sessionStorage
   - Ensured proper initialization of APP_CACHE objects
   - Added more robust token persistence across storage mechanisms

2. **Improved Token Retrieval**: Modified the OnboardingLayout component to:
   - Try multiple token retrieval mechanisms
   - Add a fallback to sessionStorage when the primary token retrieval fails
   - Properly synchronize tokens between different storage locations

3. **Public Route Handling**: Made onboarding routes public to prevent redirect loops:
   - Added special handling for routes that start with `/onboarding/`
   - Implemented optional token refresh that doesn't block rendering
   - Maintained security while preventing infinite redirect loops

## Implementation Details

The fix script modifies the following files:

1. `src/app/onboarding/layout.js`:
   - Enhanced the `handleTokenRefresh` function to use fallback token mechanisms
   - Modified the `checkAuth` function to treat onboarding routes as public
   - Added better error handling and logging

2. `src/app/auth/components/SignInForm.js`:
   - Updated token storage after successful authentication
   - Added redundant token storage in sessionStorage and APP_CACHE
   - Improved error handling and added additional logging

## Testing

To verify the fix, follow these steps:

1. Sign up as a new user
2. Sign in with the new credentials
3. Confirm you are redirected to the onboarding business info page
4. Complete the onboarding flow
5. Verify all tokens are properly stored by checking the browser's sessionStorage

## Version History
