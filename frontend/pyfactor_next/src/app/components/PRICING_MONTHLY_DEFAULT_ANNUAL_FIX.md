# Pricing Monthly Default and Annual Calculation Fix

## Version: 0037 v1.0
## Date: 2025-05-27
## Purpose: Fix pricing component default tab and annual pricing calculation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Default Tab Changed to Monthly
- **Before**: Default tab was Annual (`useState(true)`)
- **After**: Default tab is Monthly (`useState(false)`)
- **Reason**: Better user experience as most users prefer to see monthly pricing first

### 2. Annual Pricing Calculation Fixed
- **Before**: Annual pricing showed monthly prices (e.g., "$15/mo")
- **After**: Annual pricing shows yearly totals with 14% discount

#### Pricing Matrix (USA Users)
| Plan | Monthly | Annual (with 14% discount) |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| Professional | $15/mo | $154.80/year |
| Enterprise | $35/mo | $361.20/year |

#### Pricing Matrix (Developing Countries - 50% off)
| Plan | Monthly | Annual (with 14% discount) |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| Professional | $7.50/mo | $77.40/year |
| Enterprise | $17.50/mo | $180.60/year |

### 3. Billing Description Updated
- **Before**: "per month, billed annually" (confusing when showing annual prices)
- **After**: 
  - Monthly: "per month"
  - Annual: "billed annually"

## Calculation Logic

### Annual Pricing Formula
```
Annual Price = (Monthly Price × 12) × 0.86
```

### Examples
- **Professional USA**: $15 × 12 × 0.86 = $154.80/year
- **Enterprise USA**: $35 × 12 × 0.86 = $361.20/year
- **Professional Developing**: $7.50 × 12 × 0.86 = $77.40/year
- **Enterprise Developing**: $17.50 × 12 × 0.86 = $180.60/year

## Files Modified
1. `/src/app/components/Pricing.js` - Updated default state, pricing calculations, and billing text

## Benefits
- ✅ Better UX with Monthly as default tab
- ✅ Accurate annual pricing with proper yearly totals
- ✅ Clear billing descriptions
- ✅ Maintains 14% annual discount
- ✅ Maintains 50% developing country discount

## Testing
1. **Default View**: Should show Monthly tab selected by default
2. **Monthly Pricing**: Should show "/mo" prices
3. **Annual Pricing**: Should show "/year" prices with 14% discount applied
4. **Billing Text**: Should show appropriate description for each billing cycle
