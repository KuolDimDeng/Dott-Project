# USA Discount Issue Fix Documentation

## Version: 0033 v1.0
## Date: 2025-05-27
## Purpose: Fix incorrect 50% discount showing for USA users

## Issue Description
USA users were incorrectly seeing a "50% Off All Plans" discount banner, even though USA is not a developing country and should not be eligible for the discount.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Cache Issue**: Incorrect cached data from testing or development
2. **Logic Gap**: No explicit check for developed countries
3. **Debugging Lack**: Insufficient logging to identify the issue

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Explicit Developed Countries List
- Added `DEVELOPED_COUNTRIES` constant with 45+ developed nations
- USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Japan, etc.
- These countries are explicitly excluded from discounts

### 2. Enhanced Country Detection Logic
```javascript
export function isDevelopingCountry(countryCode) {
  // First check if it's explicitly a developed country
  if (DEVELOPED_COUNTRIES.includes(countryCode)) {
    return false; // NO discount
  }
  
  // Then check if it's in the developing countries list
  return DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES.includes(countryCode);
}
```

### 3. Cache Clearing Utility
- Created `cacheCleaner.js` utility
- Functions to clear incorrect cached data
- Force refresh country detection
- Debug cache state

### 4. USA-Specific Fix in Pricing Component
- Special check for USA with discount flag
- Automatic cache clearing and refresh if USA has discount
- Enhanced debugging and logging

### 5. Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive console logging
- Cache state debugging
- Country detection status logging
- Discount eligibility logging

## Files Modified
1. `/src/services/countryDetectionService.js` - Enhanced logic and debugging
2. `/src/utils/cacheCleaner.js` - New cache clearing utility
3. `/src/app/components/Pricing.js` - Added USA fix and debugging
4. `/src/utils/appCache.js` - Added clearCacheKey function

## Testing
### Manual Testing Steps
1. **USA Users**: Should see no discount banner
2. **Developing Country Users**: Should see 50% discount banner
3. **Cache Clearing**: Should work when incorrect data is detected
4. **Console Logs**: Should show clear country detection process

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// In browser console
import { debugCacheState, forceRefreshCountryDetection } from '@/utils/cacheCleaner';

// Check current cache
debugCacheState();

// Force refresh if needed
forceRefreshCountryDetection();
```

## Developed Countries (No Discount)
USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Luxembourg, Monaco, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Israel, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Brunei, Cyprus, Malta, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Croatia, Greece

## Developing Countries (50% Discount)
100+ countries including major markets in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.

## Prevention Measures
1. **Explicit Lists**: Clear separation of developed vs developing countries
2. **Cache Validation**: Automatic detection and correction of incorrect cache
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive debugging information
4. **Fallback Logic**: Safe defaults to prevent incorrect discounts
