# Banking Integration

## Overview
The Banking Integration module allows users to connect to their bank accounts based on their business location. This integration supports different banking providers globally:

- **North America & Europe**: Using Plaid for secure bank connections
- **Africa**: Using PayStack (for mobile money) or Mono/Stitch (for traditional banks)
- **South America**: Using dLocal for local bank connections
- **Asia**: Using Salt Edge for Asian bank connections

## Features
The Banking module includes:

1. Banking Dashboard (view all accounts and transactions)
2. Connect to Bank (region-specific connection methods)
3. Transaction Management (view, filter, and categorize transactions)
4. Reconciliation (match bank transactions with accounting records)
5. Reports (generate financial reports from banking data)

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

- **BankingDashboard**: Main dashboard view of connected accounts and recent transactions
- **ConnectBankManagement**: Interface for connecting to bank accounts with a tabbed interface
- **ConnectBank**: The actual connection component that handles Plaid and other integrations
- **BankTransactionPage**: View and manage individual transactions
- **BankReconciliation**: Reconcile bank transactions with accounting records
- **BankReport**: Generate reports from banking data

### Backend Components

- **Models**:
  - `BankIntegration`: Abstract base model for all bank integrations
  - `PlaidItem`: Stores Plaid connection information
  - `TinkItem`: Stores Tink connection information (European banks)
  - `BankAccount`: Represents a bank account
  - `BankTransaction`: Represents a transaction within a bank account

- **Services**:
  - `PlaidService`: Handles Plaid API communication
  - Other provider services as needed

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/banking/create_link_token/`: Creates a link token for initiating a bank connection
  - `/api/banking/exchange_token/`: Exchanges public token for access token
  - `/api/banking/accounts/`: Get all connected bank accounts
  - `/api/banking/transactions/`: Get transactions for an account
  - `/api/banking/connected-accounts/`: Get summary of all connected accounts
  - `/api/banking/connect-bank-account/`: Connect a new bank account
  - `/api/banking/report/`: Generate banking reports

## Location-Based Integration Logic

The system automatically determines the appropriate banking provider based on the user's business country:

1. Retrieves `custom:businesscountry` attribute from Cognito
2. Maps this to the appropriate region and provider
3. Pre-selects the optimal connection method in the UI

## Security Considerations

- All bank credentials are handled through secure OAuth flows
- Direct bank credentials are never stored in our database
- Access tokens are encrypted at rest
- All API communication uses TLS/SSL
- User permissions are enforced for all banking operations

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to the Banking menu in the dashboard
2. Select "Connect to Bank" to initiate a new connection
3. The system will automatically detect your region and suggest the best provider
4. Follow the authentication flow with your banking provider
5. Once connected, your accounts and transactions will be available in the Banking Dashboard

## Future Enhancements
