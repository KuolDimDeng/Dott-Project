# Settings Page Rendering Fix

## Issue
The Settings Management page was not rendering correctly when selected from the user menu in the dashboard. The logs showed:
- Navigation key change to settings-timestampvalue
- RenderMainContent: renderSettingsTabs called with selectedSettingsOption: undefined
- The Settings option was handled but not rendering the actual SettingsManagement component

## Root Cause
There were two main issues:
1. The RenderMainContent.js file had hardcoded a placeholder UI instead of actually rendering the imported SettingsManagement component
2. The selectedSettingsOption prop was not being properly passed from DashboardContent.js to RenderMainContent.js, causing it to be undefined even though it was correctly set in DashboardContent

## Solution
1. Modified the RenderMainContent.js file to properly render the SettingsManagement component when selectedSettingsOption is "Settings"
2. Fixed the prop passing in DashboardContent.js by:
   - Adding selectedSettingsOption to the mainContentProps object 
   - Adding it to the dependency array of the useMemo
   - Explicitly passing it in the RenderMainContent component JSX

## Implementation Details
- Modified the condition that checks for selectedSettingsOption === 'Settings'
- Replaced the hardcoded placeholder UI with the actual SettingsManagement component
- Added proper suspense and error handling
- Used unique keys to ensure proper remounting
- Fixed the prop passing between components to ensure proper communication

## Testing
The fix should be verified by:
1. Login to the dashboard
2. Click on the user profile button
3. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu
4. Verify the Settings Management page loads correctly with user management functionality

## Further Considerations
- The SettingsManagement component should be monitored for performance issues
- If the page is slow to load, consider optimizing data fetching or implementing pagination
- Ensure proper error handling in the SettingsManagement component itself
