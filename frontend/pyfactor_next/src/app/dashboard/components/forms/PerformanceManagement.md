# Performance Management Component

This component provides a comprehensive, role-based performance management system with different views tailored to employees, managers, HR administrators, and executives.

## Overview

The Performance Management component features a tabbed interface that displays different content based on the user's role:

1. **Employee View (Limited Access)**
   - Personal Performance Dashboard
   - Individual KPIs and goal progress tracking
   - Team Performance Overview with anonymized team metrics
   - Feedback and Self-Assessment tools

2. **Manager View (Expanded Access)**
   - Team Performance Dashboard with aggregated metrics
   - Individual Employee Deep Dives for direct reports
   - Development planning workspace
   - Training completion status tracking

3. **HR Admin View (Comprehensive Access)**
   - Organization-Wide Performance Analytics
   - Cross-department performance comparisons
   - Performance distribution analysis
   - Compensation Management Tools

4. **Executive View (Strategic Access)**
   - Strategic Performance Overview
   - Critical talent identification
   - Performance impact on business outcomes
   - System Configuration Controls

## Component Structure

The component is organized with a main container and individual view components for each role:

```jsx
function PerformanceManagement() {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('employee');

  // Tab navigation component
  const TabNavigation = () => (...);

  // Individual view components
  const EmployeeView = () => (...);
  const ManagerView = () => (...);
  const HRAdminView = () => (...);
  const ExecutiveView = () => (...);

  // Render the appropriate tab content
  const renderTabContent = () => {...};

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Performance Management</h1>
      <TabNavigation />
      <div className="mt-4">
        {renderTabContent()}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Navigation

The Performance Management component is accessible through the HR menu in the sidebar. When a user clicks on the "Performance" menu item, the `handleHRClick` function in `DashboardContent.js` sets the `showPerformanceManagement` state to true, which triggers the rendering of the Performance Management component in `RenderMainContent.js`.

## Implementation Details

- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Role-based access control
- Tab-based navigation between different views
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Performance Management component:

1. Integration with actual employee data from the database
2. PDF export functionality for performance reports
3. Email notifications for performance reviews
4. Goal-setting wizard
5. Integration with compensation planning tools
