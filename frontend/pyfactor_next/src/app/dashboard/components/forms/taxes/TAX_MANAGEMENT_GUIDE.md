This guide explains how to use the Employee Tax Management system in the HR Tax section of Dott. This system allows HR staff to manage employee tax forms, including W-4 withholding certificates, state withholding forms, and W-2 wage statements.

## Overview

The Employee Tax Management system provides the following capabilities:

- Search for employees by name, ID, or department
- View employee tax information
- Add new tax forms for employees
- Edit existing tax forms

- Track submission status of tax forms

## Employee Tax Forms

### Federal Forms

1. **W-4 (Employee's Withholding Certificate)**
   - Used by employers to determine how much federal income tax to withhold from an employee's pay
   - Required fields: Filing Status, Allowances, Additional Withholding
   - Employees can claim exemption from withholding if they meet specific criteria

2. **W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement)**
   - Annual statement showing wages paid and taxes withheld
   - Provided to employees by January 31st for the previous calendar year
   - Copies must be sent to the Social Security Administration

3. **1095-C (Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage)**
   - Shows information about employer-provided health insurance
   - Required for Applicable Large Employers (ALEs)

4. **1099-MISC (Miscellaneous Income)**
   - Used to report payments made to independent contractors
   - Not typically used for employees, but can be tracked in the system

### State Forms

State withholding forms vary by state, but generally collect similar information to the federal W-4. The system allows HR staff to manage state-specific withholding forms for employees.
