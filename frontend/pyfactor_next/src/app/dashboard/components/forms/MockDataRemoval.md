# Mock Data Removal - EmployeeManagement Component

## Overview

The mock data functionality has been removed from the EmployeeManagement component to ensure that the application always connects to the live AWS RDS database as required by the strict production environment requirements.

## Changes Made

The following changes were implemented:

1. **Removed Mock Data Toggle Button**
   - Removed the UI toggle button that previously allowed switching between real and mock data
   - Removed all associated code for handling mock mode toggling

2. **Removed LocalStorage Usage**
   - Eliminated all usage of localStorage to store mock mode preferences
   - This ensures compliance with the "No cookies or local storage" requirement

3. **Removed Mock Data Fetching**
   - Removed all code paths that would fetch mock data from the local API route
   - The component now exclusively uses the real backend API via the employeeApi functions

4. **Removed Debug Options**
   - Removed mock data-related debug options from the error display section

## Benefits

These changes ensure:

1. Data integrity by always using real data from the backend
2. Compliance with strict tenant isolation requirements
3. Consistent behavior in production environments
4. No reliance on localStorage for application state

## Implementation Details

The change was implemented through a script that:
- Creates a backup of the original file
- Systematically removes all mock data related code
- Updates imports and dependencies as needed
- Maintains all other functionality intact

## Script

The script `Version0001_remove_mock_data_from_EmployeeManagement.js` was created to implement these changes. The script includes:
- Backup creation for safety
- Registry updates to track changes
- Detailed logging of the modification process

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. The component should successfully load employee data from the real backend
2. No mock data toggle buttons should appear in the UI 
3. No references to localStorage should be present in the code
4. The application should function normally with real data

## Additional Notes

This change aligns with the strict production requirements, which specify:
- No mock data (connect to live AWS RDS database)
- No localStorage or cookies
- Strict tenant isolation
