# EmployeeManagement.js Syntax Fix

## Issue
The EmployeeManagement.js file contained syntax errors that prevented the application from building:
- Extra semicolon after catch block closing brace
- Comment text mixed with code causing syntax errors

## Fix Details
- **Date:** 2025-04-26
- **Script:** Version0005_Fix_Syntax_EmployeeManagement.js
- **Version:** 1.0

### Changes Made
1. Removed extra semicolon after catch block
2. Properly formatted comment that was mixed with code
3. Ensured proper syntax around the "If we couldn't get user data from any source" comment

### Technical Details
The issue was around line 2540-2543 where a comment became part of the code causing a syntax error:

```javascript
// Before fix
          } catch (cognitoError) {
            console.error('Error fetching from Cognito:', cognitoError);
          };
 from any source, use empty defaults
        if (!userData) {

// After fix
          } catch (cognitoError) {
            console.error('Error fetching from Cognito:', cognitoError);
          }

        // If we couldn't get user data from any source, use empty defaults
        if (!userData) {
```

A backup of the original file was created before making changes.
