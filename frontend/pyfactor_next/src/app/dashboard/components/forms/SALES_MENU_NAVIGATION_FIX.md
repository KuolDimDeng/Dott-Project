# Sales Menu Navigation Fix

## Issue Description

When clicking on the Products or Services items in the Sales menu, the content wasn't rendering in the main content area of the dashboard. This happened despite the product management page and service management functionality already existing in the application.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The `handleSalesClick` function in `DashboardContent.js` wasn't properly setting the state needed to render the components.
2. For Services, a wrapper component similar to `SalesProductManagement` was missing.
3. The `RenderMainContent` component wasn't including the `showServiceManagement` prop in its parameter list and wasn't rendering the service management component when appropriate.

## Implementation Details

The fix implements the following changes:

### 1. Created `SalesServiceManagement.js` Component

Created a wrapper component for `ServiceManagement` that sets the `salesContext` prop to true, similar to how `SalesProductManagement` works for `ProductManagement`.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ServiceManagement from './ServiceManagement';

const SalesServiceManagement = (props) => {
  return (
    <ServiceManagement 
      salesContext={true}
      {...props}
    />
  );
};

export default SalesServiceManagement;
```

### 2. Updated `handleSalesClick` in `DashboardContent.js`

Enhanced the `handleSalesClick` function to:
- Generate a unique navigation key for component remounting
- Set the proper state values for Products and Services menu items
- Improve logging for better debugging

```javascript
const handleSalesClick = useCallback((value) => {
  resetAllStates();
  console.log('[DashboardContent] Sales option selected:', value);
  
  // Generate a unique navigation key for component remounting
  const salesNavKey = `sales-${Date.now()}`;
  
  switch(value) {
    case 'products':
      updateState({ 
        showProductManagement: true,
        navigationKey: salesNavKey
      });
      break;
    case 'services':
      updateState({ 
        showServiceManagement: true,
        navigationKey: salesNavKey
      });
      break;
    // Other cases...
  }
  
  console.log(`[DashboardContent] Navigating to Sales ${value} with key ${salesNavKey}`);
}, [resetAllStates, updateState]);
```

### 3. Updated `RenderMainContent.js`

Modified the component to:
- Import the `SalesServiceManagement` component
- Add `showServiceManagement` to the function parameters
- Add conditional rendering for the `SalesServiceManagement` component

## Testing

After applying this fix:
1. Click on "Products" in the Sales menu navigates to the Products management page
2. Click on "Services" in the Sales menu navigates to the Services management page
3. Both pages maintain their state and work as expected

## Files Modified

1. Created: `/src/app/dashboard/components/forms/SalesServiceManagement.js`
2. Modified: `/src/components/Dashboard/DashboardContent.js`
3. Modified: `/src/components/Dashboard/RenderMainContent.js`

## Implementation Script

The fix is implemented through a script: `Version0001_fix_SalesMenu_Navigation.js`

This script:
1. Creates a backup of each file before modification
2. Creates the missing `SalesServiceManagement.js` component
3. Updates the `handleSalesClick` function in `DashboardContent.js`
4. Updates the `RenderMainContent.js` component to handle service management
5. Updates the script registry to track implementation
