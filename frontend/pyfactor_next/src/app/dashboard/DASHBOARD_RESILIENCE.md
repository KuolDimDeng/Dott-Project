# Dashboard Resilience Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture changes made to improve dashboard resilience, especially handling tenant redirections and chunk loading errors that were causing the dashboard to fail after login.

## Key Changes (2025-04-19)

### 1. Enhanced Error Recovery (Updated)
- Added comprehensive chunk loading error detection and recovery
- Implemented service worker and cache clearing for network errors
- Added URL-based recovery tracking to prevent infinite reload loops
- Improved handling of network errors during API calls

### 2. Improved Error Boundaries (Updated)
- Enhanced global error handlers in Providers component
- Added specific error handling for network and chunk loading errors
- Implemented automatic recovery triggers for severe errors
- Better error filtering to prevent unnecessary page reloads

### 1. Enhanced Error Recovery
- Added comprehensive chunk loading error detection and recovery
- Implemented service worker and cache clearing for network errors
- Added URL-based recovery tracking to prevent infinite reload loops

### 2. Improved Error Boundaries
- Enhanced global error handlers in Providers component
- Added specific error handling for network and chunk loading errors
- Implemented automatic recovery triggers for severe errors

### 3. Dashboard Component Resilience
- Strengthened dashboard loader with better error detection
- Added cache busting for page reloads
- Implemented progressive recovery with fallback mechanisms

## Error Recovery Flow
1. User authentication completes successfully
2. If chunk loading errors occur during dashboard load:
   - Error is caught by global event listener
   - Service workers are unregistered to clear cached resources
   - Browser caches are cleared
   - Page is reloaded with cache-busting parameters
   - Recovery attempt is tracked to prevent infinite loops

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Recovery Script
- Enhanced error detection for various failure types
- Added service worker and cache management
- Implemented URL-based recovery tracking

### Dashboard Loader Component
- Improved error type detection and handling
- Added automatic recovery for severe errors
- Enhanced URL parameter handling for recovery state

### Global Error Handling
- Enhanced Providers component with better error filtering
- Added unhandled rejection handling
- Improved error prevention and propagation control

## Security Considerations
- All recovery mechanisms comply with security requirements
- No cookies or local storage used for recovery state
- Recovery tracking uses URL parameters only
- No tenant isolation issues

## Log Monitoring
- Added enhanced error logging for better diagnostics
- Improved error type classification
- Added recovery attempt tracking

## Version History
- v1.1 (2025-04-19): Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- v1.0 (2025-04-18): Initial implementation
