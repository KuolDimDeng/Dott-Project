# Dashboard Re-rendering Fix

## Issue
The dashboard was encountering an infinite re-rendering loop due to several interrelated issues:

1. The `DashboardLoader` component was detecting network errors and initiating recovery processes without proper cooldown/throttling.
2. The `UserProfileContext` was repeatedly attempting to fetch profile data when encountering errors.
3. The emergency menu fix script was being applied multiple times, adding event listeners repeatedly.

These issues collectively created a cycle of error detection, recovery attempts, and re-rendering that degraded performance and prevented the dashboard from loading properly.

## Solution
A script-based fix has been implemented that:

1. Patches `window.addEventListener` to prevent multiple error handlers from triggering in rapid succession
2. Adds debounce to network requests to the profile API to prevent request flooding
3. Prevents multiple applications of the emergency menu fix script
4. Tracks recovery attempts in the `window.__APP_CACHE` object to limit them
5. Returns mock successful responses for repeated profile requests to break infinite loops

## Implementation Details

### Script Location
The fix is implemented in:
- `/public/scripts/Version0003_fix_dashboard_rerendering.js`

### Applied In
The script is included in:
- `/src/app/tenant/[tenantId]/dashboard/layout.js`

### Operation
The script applies runtime patches to:
- Event listener registration
- Fetch API for profile requests
- Dashboard error recovery mechanism
- Emergency menu fix application

### Verification
When correctly applied, the console should show logs prefixed with `[RerenderFix]` indicating the script has loaded and applied its patches. The dashboard should load without continuous network requests or repeated error messages.
