# Settings Management Component

## Overview
The Settings Management component provides a comprehensive settings interface for managing various aspects of the application. It includes a sidebar navigation system that allows users to access different settings sections.

## Features

- **Payment**: Payment and billing settings (placeholder)
- **Security & Compliance**: Security settings and compliance configuration (placeholder) 
- **Payroll Configuration**: Settings for payroll management (placeholder)

- **Regional Settings**: Language, timezone, and locale settings (placeholder)

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
The component uses a tab-based navigation with a sidebar for section selection and a main content area that displays the active section. This provides a clean, organized interface that can be easily extended with additional settings sections.

### State Management
- `activeSection`: Tracks the currently selected settings section
- User Management states: 
  - `employees`: List of employees that can be invited
  - `loading`: Loading state for API calls
  - `error`: Error state for API calls
  - `showAddUserForm`: Controls visibility of add user form
  - `newUser`: State for the new user form data

### API Integration
- Uses `employeeApi.getAll()` to fetch employees
- Uses `api.post('/api/hr/employees/invite')` to send invitations to users

### Security
- Implements role-based access control via the `isOwner()` function
- Only users with owner privileges can manage users

### Responsiveness
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly layout that stacks the sidebar above content on small screens

## Usage
The Settings Management component is typically accessed from the user menu in the dashboard. It provides a centralized location for all application settings, making it easy for administrators to configure the system.

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement the placeholder sections with real functionality
2. Add more granular permission controls
3. Create audit logs for settings changes
4. Add search functionality for large settings sections
5. Implement settings export/import capabilities

## Technical Requirements
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements AWS Cognito for authentication
- Avoids using cookies or local storage
- Designed to scale for applications with large user bases
- Uses AWS RDS Database with RLS Policy
- Maintains strict tenant isolation
