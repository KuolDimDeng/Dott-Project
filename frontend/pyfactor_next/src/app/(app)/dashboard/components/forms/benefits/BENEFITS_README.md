# Benefits Management Component

## Overview
The Benefits Management component is part of the HR section in the application. It allows employees to view their benefits, administrators to manage employee benefits, and owners to configure benefits settings for the organization.

## Components Structure
- **BenefitsManagement.js**: Main component that contains tabs for different functions
  - **MyBenefits.js**: Shows the current employee's benefits information
  - **BenefitsAdmin.js**: Administrative interface for managing employee benefits (HR Managers, Admins)
  - **BenefitsSettings.js**: Configuration interface for company-wide benefits settings (Owners, Admins)
  - **tabs/**: Contains subcomponents for various tabs
    - **ManageBenefits.js**: Interface for managing specific benefits
    - **BenefitsSummary.js**: Summary view of benefits status
    - **BenefitsDocuments.js**: Document management for benefits

## Navigation Flow
1. User clicks on "Benefits" in HR menu in the sidebar
2. `handleHRClick('benefits')` is called from listItems.js
3. In DashboardContent.js, this sets `showBenefitsManagement` to true
4. RenderMainContent.js renders the BenefitsManagement component
5. BenefitsManagement.js displays the appropriate tabs based on user role

## Permissions
- **All Users**: Can view their own benefits (MyBenefits tab)
- **HR Managers**: Can view and manage benefits for all employees (BenefitsAdmin tab)
- **Owners/Admins**: Can configure company-wide benefits settings (BenefitsSettings tab)

## Data Flow
Benefits data is loaded from the backend when the component mounts. User permissions are determined by the roles stored in Cognito attributes.

## Recent Fixes
- **Version0005_fix_Benefits_Menu_Item_RenderMainContent.cjs**: Fixed the Benefits menu item in the HR menu to properly render the Benefits Management page by ensuring the `showBenefitsManagement` state is properly passed from DashboardContent to RenderMainContent.
- **Version0006_fix_Benefits_Radio_Buttons_And_Owner_Access.cjs**: Fixed two issues:
  1. Added proper state management and onChange handlers to radio inputs in ManageBenefits.js to eliminate React warnings
  2. Updated role checking logic in BenefitsManagement.js to properly detect the 'owner' role from 'custom:userrole' attribute, ensuring owners can access all tabs

## Important Notes
- Radio buttons in the benefits form (ManageBenefits.js) now properly update their state when clicked
- The access control logic checks both 'custom:roles' (array) and 'custom:userrole' (string) Cognito attributes to determine owner status
- Owners should now have access to all tabs in the Benefits Management interface
