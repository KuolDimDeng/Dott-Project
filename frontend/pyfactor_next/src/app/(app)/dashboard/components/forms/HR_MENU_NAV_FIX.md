# HR Menu Navigation Fix

## Issue Description

When clicking on the "Pay" and "Timesheet" menu items in the HR section, these components were not properly rendering in the content area, while the "Employee" menu item was working correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, we identified two issues:

1. The `showPayManagement` state was not being properly passed to the `RenderMainContent` component in `DashboardContent.js`.
2. The navigation pattern for the "Pay" and "Timesheet" menu items was different from the "Employee" menu item, which was using a more robust approach with custom events.

## Fix Implementation

The following changes were made:

1. Updated `DashboardContent.js` to correctly pass `showPayManagement` state to the `RenderMainContent` component:
   ```javascript
   showTimesheetManagement: uiState.showTimesheetManagement,
   showPayManagement: uiState.showPayManagement,
   ```

2. Updated the menu items in `listItems.js` to use the same navigation pattern for all HR menu items:
   - For "Timesheet" and "Pay" menu items, implemented the same approach as the "Employee" menu item
   - Added generation of a unique `navigationKey` for each navigation action 
   - Added dispatching of navigation events for all listeners
   - Directly called the handler function with the appropriate section parameter

## Testing

The fix was tested by:
1. Clicking on the "Employee" menu item (baseline functionality)
2. Clicking on the "Timesheet" menu item (previously not working)
3. Clicking on the "Pay" menu item (previously not working)

All menu items now correctly render their respective components in the content area.
