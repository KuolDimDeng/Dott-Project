# CORS and Authentication Fix Documentation

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes | Author |

| 1.0 | 2023-11-28 | Fixed CORS and authentication issues in HR API requests | System |

## Issue Overview

The Employee Management component was failing to load data due to two primary issues:

1. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Errors**: The frontend was sending headers that were being rejected by the backend's CORS configuration, particularly:
   - `x-business-id` header was being rejected
   - Multiple tenant ID headers with different formats caused preflight failures

2. **Authentication Failures**: The backend was correctly returning 401 Unauthorized responses because:
   - Authentication tokens weren't being properly sent with requests
   - Token refresh was not properly integrated with request retries

## Changes Made

### 1. Axios Configuration Updates

- **Standardized Headers**: Removed problematic headers that triggered CORS issues
- **Simplified Request Configuration**: Used only the essential headers required by the backend
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added specific detection and handling for CORS errors
- **Improved Token Management**: Better integration with Amplify auth session
- **Added Retry Mechanism**: Implemented smart retry behavior for network errors, particularly CORS issues

### 2. API Client Improvements

- **Simplified Header Structure**: Reduced headers to only those explicitly supported by the backend
- **Added Fallback Mechanism**: If direct API calls fail with CORS errors, falls back to API proxy route
- **Improved Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to help diagnose connection issues
- **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Better handling of network errors and authentication failures

## Backend Requirements

For these changes to work correctly, the backend must have CORS configured to accept:
- `Authorization` header
- `X-Tenant-ID` header
- `Content-Type` header
- `Accept` header

## Testing the Fix

After applying this fix:
1. The Employee Management component should load properly
2. API requests should include the correct headers for authentication
3. CORS errors should be eliminated, with graceful fallbacks if they still occur
4. Authentication should be maintained properly, with token refresh as needed

## Additional Considerations

If CORS issues persist, the backend should be updated to explicitly allow the headers being sent by the frontend, particularly:
- Ensure the backend's CORS configuration includes all headers used by the frontend
- Consider updating the backend to accept tenant ID as query parameter if header-based approach continues to face issues
