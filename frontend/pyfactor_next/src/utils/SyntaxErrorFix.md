# Syntax Error Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing build errors due to a syntax issue in the `tenantUtils.js` file. The error was:

```
Error: × Expression expected
./src/utils/tenantUtils.js

Error: × Expression expected
     ╭─[/Users/kuoldeng/projectx/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/utils/tenantUtils.js:222:1]

 220 │     return false;

     ·     ─

Caused by:
    Syntax Error
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by extra closing curly braces at the end of the `storeTenantId` function in `tenantUtils.js`. There were three closing braces when only one was needed, resulting in a JavaScript syntax error.

This issue was likely introduced during a previous fix attempt when multiple edits were being made to the file.

## Solution
A fix script (`Version0004_fix_syntax.js`) was created to remove the extra closing braces in `tenantUtils.js`, ensuring there was only one closing brace at the end of the `storeTenantId` function.

The fix involved:
1. Creating a backup of the original file
2. Removing the extra `}` characters on lines 222-223
3. Ensuring proper function structure

## Implementation
1. A backup of the file was created with a timestamp
2. The extra closing braces were removed, leaving only the required ones
3. The script registry was updated to track this change

## Verification
After applying this fix, the Next.js server successfully compiled without syntax errors.
