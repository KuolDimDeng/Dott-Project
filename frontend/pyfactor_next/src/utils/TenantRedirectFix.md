# Authentication Redirect Fix

## Issue Description
After successful sign-in, users were not being redirected to the dashboard. The sign-in process completed successfully, but when the system tried to store the tenant ID in Cognito, it failed with an HTTP 400 error:

```
11:34:11.394 [SignInForm] Onboarding complete, redirecting to dashboard
11:34:11.394 [tenantUtils] Storing tenant ID in Cognito: f25a8e7f-2b43-5798-ae3d-51d803089261
11:34:11.419 XHRPOST https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ [HTTP/2 400 249ms]
```

## Root Cause
In the `tenantUtils.js` file, the `storeTenantId` function was using the direct `updateUserAttributes` function from AWS Amplify, which was failing with a 400 error during the Cognito API call. This issue occurred because:

1. The direct call lacked proper error handling and retry mechanisms
2. No fallback was in place if the Cognito API call failed
3. The tenant ID wasn't being stored in the local AppCache as a backup

## Solution
A fix script (`Version0003_fix_tenant_redirect.js`) was created to modify the `storeTenantId` function in `tenantUtils.js` to:

1. Use the `resilientUpdateUserAttributes` function instead of the direct `updateUserAttributes` call
2. Add AppCache storage for the tenant ID as a redundant backup
3. Ensure proper imports for the required functions

The changes:
```javascript
// Original implementation
await updateUserAttributes({
  userAttributes: {
    'custom:tenant_ID': tenantId,
    // ...
  }
});

// New implementation
// Store in AppCache for redundancy
setCacheValue('tenantId', tenantId);

// Use resilient implementation that handles retries and timeouts
await resilientUpdateUserAttributes({
  userAttributes: {
    'custom:tenant_ID': tenantId,
    // ...
  }
});
```

## Implementation
1. The original file was backed up with a timestamp in the `/backups` directory
2. The imports were updated to include `resilientUpdateUserAttributes` and `setCacheValue`
3. The `storeTenantId` function was updated to use the resilient implementation and add AppCache storage
4. The script registry was updated to track this change

## Verification
After applying this fix, users should now be successfully redirected to the dashboard after sign-in, even if there are temporary issues with the Cognito API.
