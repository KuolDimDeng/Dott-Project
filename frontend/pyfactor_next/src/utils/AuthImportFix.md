# Authentication Import Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing authentication failures due to a code issue in the `authUtils.js` file. Users were unable to sign in, receiving the error:

```
Uncaught ModuleParseError: Module parse failed: Identifier 'signOut' has already been declared (430:16)
```

## Root Cause
In the `authUtils.js` file, the `signOut` function was imported twice:
1. At the top level of the file: `import { fetchAuthSession, signIn, signOut, getCurrentUser } from 'aws-amplify/auth';`
2. Within the `clearAllAuthData` function: `const { signOut } = await import('aws-amplify/auth');`

This duplicate declaration was causing the JavaScript compiler to fail when trying to parse the module, resulting in authentication failures.

## Solution
A fix script (`Version0002_fix_duplicate_signOut_import.js`) was created to modify the `clearAllAuthData` function in `authUtils.js` to remove the duplicate import of `signOut`, instead relying on the existing import at the top of the file.

The change:
```javascript
// Original (line ~430)
const { signOut } = await import('aws-amplify/auth');

// Fixed
// Using signOut imported at the top of the file
const { /* signOut already imported */ } = await import('aws-amplify/auth');
```

## Implementation
1. The original file was backed up with a timestamp in the `/backups` directory
2. The duplicate import was replaced with a comment indicating the function is already imported
3. The script registry was updated to track this change

## Verification
After applying this fix, users should be able to successfully sign in without encountering the module parse error.
