# Dashboard Stability Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to enhance dashboard stability, particularly focused on solving issues related to network errors, aborted operations, and tenant identification after sign-in.

## Core Issues Addressed

1. **NetworkError when attempting to fetch resources**
   - Improved fetch operations with proper error handling
   - Added retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Implemented timeout handling to prevent hanging operations

2. **ChunkLoadError for dashboard components**
   - Added detection and specific handling for chunk loading errors
   - Implemented cache clearing for failed chunks
   - Added cache-busting parameters to prevent loading corrupted chunks

3. **Unsupported type error in React.use()**
   - Fixed parameter handling in TenantCatchAllPage
   - Removed direct use of React.use() in favor of safer alternatives
   - Added proper error boundaries for React components

4. **Aborted operations in networkMonitor.js**
   - Implemented proper AbortController handling
   - Added guards against multiple concurrent operations
   - Fixed race conditions in health checks and API calls

5. **Emergency recovery mechanism improvements**
   - Added throttling to prevent multiple concurrent recoveries
   - Implemented safer navigation with setTimeout to avoid aborts
   - Added comprehensive error handling for all recovery operations

## Key Files Modified

1. **`src/app/[tenantId]/[...slug]/page.js`**
   - Fixed React.use() error by safely accessing params
   - Added better error handling for navigation operations
   - Improved tenant ID extraction and validation

2. **`src/utils/networkMonitor.js`**
   - Improved AbortController handling for all fetch operations
   - Added concurrency control for API health checks
   - Enhanced logging and error classification
   - Added proper timeouts with cleanup for all network operations

3. **`src/hooks/useTenantRecovery.js`**
   - Added operation tracking to prevent race conditions
   - Enhanced tenant ID extraction from multiple sources
   - Improved redirect handling to prevent loops
   - Added comprehensive error handling for all operations

4. **`src/utils/tenantFallback.js`**
   - Added throttling for emergency recovery operations
   - Enhanced tenant ID storage with AppCache support
   - Improved navigation with setTimeout to prevent aborts
   - Added comprehensive error handling for storage operations

5. **`src/app/dashboard/page.js`**
   - Enhanced dynamic import with retry mechanisms
   - Added error boundaries for dashboard components
   - Improved loading state management

## Key Improvements

### In-Memory AppCache

Implemented a reliable in-memory cache that persists critical state across components:

```javascript
window.__APP_CACHE = window.__APP_CACHE || {};
window.__APP_CACHE.auth = {
  accessToken: "token-value",
  idToken: "id-token-value",
  refreshed: timestamp
};
window.__APP_CACHE.tenant = {
  id: "tenant-id"
};
```

This approach eliminates reliance on cookies and localStorage for critical session data.

### Enhanced Network Resilience

1. **Improved fetch operations**:
   - Added proper timeout handling with AbortController
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Added specific error handling for network failures

2. **Health check improvements**:
   - Added concurrency control to prevent multiple simultaneous checks
   - Improved error handling for timeouts and aborted operations
   - Added proper cleanup for all health check operations

### Tenant ID Management

1. **Multiple fallback mechanisms**:
   - URL-based tenant ID extraction
   - AppCache storage
   - Cognito custom attributes
   - Local/session storage

2. **Redundant storage**:
   - All tenant IDs are stored in multiple locations
   - Added validation and sanitization for all tenant IDs
   - Implemented tracking for successful tenant ID operations

### Error Recovery

1. **Improved error boundaries**:
   - Added specific handling for chunk loading errors
   - Implemented cache clearing for failed chunks
   - Added automatic recovery for network errors

2. **Emergency recovery**:
   - Added throttling to prevent recovery loops
   - Implemented safer navigation with setTimeout
   - Added proper cleanup after recovery attempts

## Best Practices

When working with these systems, follow these best practices:

1. **Tenant ID Handling**
   - Always validate tenant IDs with isValidUUID before use
   - Store tenant IDs in AppCache for reliability
   - Use multiple fallback mechanisms for tenant identification

2. **Network Operations**
   - Use monitoredFetch instead of direct fetch for all API calls
   - Implement proper timeout handling with AbortController
   - Add retry logic for critical operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add proper error boundaries around dynamic imports
   - Implement specific handling for different error types
   - Add recovery mechanisms for known error scenarios

4. **State Management**
   - Use AppCache for critical application state
   - Implement proper cleanup for all stateful operations
   - Add redundancy for important state (like tenant ID)

## Future Improvements

1. **Service Worker**
   - Implement a service worker for offline support
   - Add background synchronization for critical operations
   - Implement proper caching for static assets

2. **Error Telemetry**
   - Add comprehensive error tracking
   - Implement automatic error reporting
   - Add user-friendly error messages

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add performance tracking for critical operations
   - Implement automatic performance optimization
   - Add user-friendly performance indicators
