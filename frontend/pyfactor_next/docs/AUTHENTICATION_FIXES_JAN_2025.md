# Authentication Fixes - January 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the authentication issues fixed in January 2025, specifically related to users with paid tiers being unable to sign in after clearing browser cache.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Session Creation 403 Forbidden Error
**Problem**: Users with paid tiers (Professional/Enterprise) who completed payment and onboarding could not sign back in after clearing browser cache. The backend session creation endpoint was returning 403 Forbidden errors.

**Root Cause**: 
- The RLS (Row-Level Security) middleware required tenant context for session creation
- The `/api/sessions/create/` endpoint was not in the public paths list
- Session creation was being called before tenant context was established

**Solution**:
- Added `/api/sessions/` to the RLS middleware public paths in `enhanced_rls_middleware.py`
- This allows session creation without requiring tenant context

### 2. Onboarding Status Not Persisting
**Problem**: Users who completed payment for paid tiers had their onboarding status stuck at 'setup' instead of 'complete', causing them to be redirected to onboarding instead of their dashboard.

**Root Cause**:
- Backend onboarding status wasn't being properly updated after payment completion
- The `OnboardingProgress` model had fields that weren't being saved correctly

**Solution**:
- Created `fix_all_incomplete_onboarding.py` script to fix all affected users
- The script finds users with paid plans who completed payment but have incomplete onboarding status
- Updates their status to 'complete' and marks setup as completed
- Clears active sessions to force fresh login

## Affected Users
- support@dottapps.com (Professional tier)
- kdeng@dottapps.com (Professional tier)
- Any other users with paid tiers who completed payment but couldn't sign back in

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. `/backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/enhanced_rls_middleware.py`
   - Added `/api/sessions/` to public paths

2. `/backend/pyfactor/scripts/fix_complete_onboarding_status.py`
   - Script to fix individual user onboarding status

3. `/backend/pyfactor/scripts/fix_all_incomplete_onboarding.py`
   - Comprehensive script to fix all affected users

### Frontend
1. `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/auth/clear-cache/route.js`
   - New endpoint to clear session cookies and force fresh data fetch

## How to Use Fix Scripts

### Fix Individual User
```bash
cd /backend/pyfactor
python scripts/fix_complete_onboarding_status.py
```

### Fix All Affected Users
```bash
cd /backend/pyfactor
python scripts/fix_all_incomplete_onboarding.py
```

### Clear Frontend Cache
Users can visit `/api/auth/clear-cache` to clear their session cookies and force a fresh login.

## Testing

### Before Fix
1. User signs up with paid tier (Professional/Enterprise)
2. Completes payment and onboarding
3. Can access dashboard
4. Clears browser cache
5. Cannot sign back in - gets 403 error or redirected to onboarding

### After Fix
1. User clears browser cache
2. Signs in successfully
3. Redirected to tenant-specific dashboard
4. Onboarding status shows as 'complete'

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Ensure session creation endpoints are in RLS public paths
2. Verify onboarding status is properly updated after payment
3. Test sign-in flow after clearing browser cache for all tier types
