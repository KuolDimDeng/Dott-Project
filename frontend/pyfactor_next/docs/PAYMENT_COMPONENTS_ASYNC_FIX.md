# Payment Components Async TenantId Fix - January 2025

## Issue
Payment components were experiencing infinite re-render loops causing:
- Pages stuck loading
- Multiple session API calls in rapid succession  
- Components never fully rendering
- Browser console showing `[PaymentPlans] Plans loaded successfully` repeatedly

## Root Cause
The payment components were incorrectly using `getSecureTenantId()` which is an async function:

```javascript
// INCORRECT - This returns a Promise object, not a string
const tenantId = getSecureTenantId();
```

Since `tenantId` was a Promise object that changed on every render, and it was in the dependency array of `fetchPlans`, this caused:
1. Component renders
2. `tenantId` = new Promise object
3. `fetchPlans` dependency changes
4. `useEffect` runs `fetchPlans`
5. Component re-renders
6. Repeat infinitely

## Solution
Changed all payment components to properly handle async tenant ID:

```javascript
// CORRECT - Use state and effect to handle async operation
const [tenantId, setTenantId] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchTenantId = async () => {
    const id = await getSecureTenantId();
    setTenantId(id);
  };
  fetchTenantId();
}, []);

// Wait for tenant ID to load
if (!tenantId) {
  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-64">
      <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-12 w-12 border-t-2 border-b-2 border-blue-500"></div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Files Fixed
1. PaymentPlans.js
2. PaymentGateways.js
3. PaymentMethods.js
4. PaymentsDashboard.js
5. ReceivePayments.js
6. MakePayments.js
7. RecurringPayments.js
8. RefundsManagement.js
9. PaymentReconciliation.js
10. PaymentReports.js

## Additional Fix
Also fixed the navigation issue where payment menu items were calling both:
- Event dispatch (correct)
- `handlePaymentsClick` function (causing state reset)

Removed the redundant function calls from `listItems.js`.

## Result
- Payment pages now load correctly
- No more infinite re-renders
- Session API calls reduced to normal levels
- Components render properly with tenant data
