# Common Issues & Solutions - Troubleshooting Guide

*This document contains recurring issues and their proven solutions to prevent re-debugging.*

## üîß **Issue: Module Creates Successfully But Fetching Returns Empty Results**

**Symptoms:**
- POST requests work (201 Created responses)
- Objects created with correct `tenant_id` in database
- GET requests return 200 OK but empty array `[]`
- Frontend logs show "Fetched [module]: 0" despite successful creation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **OnboardingMiddleware Inconsistency**: Some modules in `PROTECTED_PATHS`, others in `EXEMPT_PATHS`
2. **Authentication Flow Mismatch**: Different auth patterns between modules
3. **RLS Context Issues**: Tenant context not properly set during authentication

**Solution (Proven Fix):**
```python
# In: /backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/middleware_package/onboarding_middleware.py

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Add module to EXEMPT_PATHS
EXEMPT_PATHS = [
    '/api/crm/',       # Customers
    '/api/inventory/', # Suppliers, Products
    '/api/hr/',        # Employees
    # Add new modules here
]

# ‚ùå REMOVE from PROTECTED_PATHS
PROTECTED_PATHS = [
    '/api/accounting/',  # Only truly restricted modules
    '/api/reports/',
]
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. Check browser network tab: ensure no 403 responses
2. Verify tenant_id in created objects matches session tenant
3. Test both creation and fetching in same session
4. Check backend logs for middleware blocking messages

**Prevention:**
- Always add new modules to `EXEMPT_PATHS` initially
- Use industry-standard API pattern for all modules
- Test both create AND fetch operations during development

**Related Issues:**
- Module works in development but fails in production
- Inconsistent behavior between different resource types
- Frontend shows cached data but API returns empty

## üîß **Issue: Authentication Errors After Onboarding Changes**

**Symptoms:**
- 401 Unauthorized on previously working endpoints
- Session appears valid but backend rejects requests
- User logged in but gets permission denied

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Middleware Order**: Authentication middleware running after blocking middleware
2. **Session Context**: RLS context not set during authentication process
3. **Cookie/Session Mismatch**: Frontend and backend session state out of sync

**Solution:**
1. Check middleware order in Django settings
2. Verify RLS context setting in authentication classes
3. Clear browser cookies and re-authenticate
4. Check session expiry and refresh tokens

**Prevention:**
- Test authentication flow after any middleware changes
- Use consistent session management patterns
- Monitor authentication logs for context issues

## üîß **Issue: Database Query Errors in Dashboard Middleware**

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: operator does not exist: information_schema.sql_identifier = uuid
LINE 4: WHERE table_schema = 'cb86762b-3...'
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Dashboard middleware comparing UUID to string incorrectly
- PostgreSQL type system enforcement in schema queries

**Solution:**
1. Cast UUID to text in schema comparison queries
2. Update dashboard middleware schema detection logic
3. Consider removing legacy schema-based tenant isolation

**Prevention:**
- Use consistent data types in SQL comparisons
- Test middleware with real UUID tenant IDs
- Monitor database logs for type mismatch errors
