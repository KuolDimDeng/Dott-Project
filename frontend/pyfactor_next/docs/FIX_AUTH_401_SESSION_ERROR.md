# Fix for Backend Error: 401 - No Active Session

## Issue Description
After signing in with the new session system (sid/session_token cookies), users were getting a "Backend error: 401 - No active session" error when authFlowHandler.v3 tried to call the `/api/user/create-auth0-user` endpoint.

## Root Cause
The `/api/user/create-auth0-user` endpoint was only checking for old session cookies (dott_auth_session/appSession) and not recognizing the new session cookies (sid/session_token).

## Fix Applied

### Updated `/api/user/create-auth0-user/route.js`
- Added check for new session cookies (sid/session_token) before checking old ones
- When new session cookies are found:
  - Constructs session data from the request body (auth0_sub, email, etc.)
  - Gets access token from Authorization header
  - Properly handles the new session format
- Falls back to old session format for backward compatibility

## How It Works Now

1. User signs in and gets new session cookies (sid/session_token)
2. authFlowHandler.v3 calls `/api/user/create-auth0-user` with user data
3. The endpoint now recognizes the new session cookies
4. It constructs the session data from the request body and Authorization header
5. Proceeds with the user sync process successfully

## Testing
1. Sign in with email/password
2. Verify no 401 error occurs
3. Check that user is properly redirected to dashboard or onboarding
4. Verify session remains active
