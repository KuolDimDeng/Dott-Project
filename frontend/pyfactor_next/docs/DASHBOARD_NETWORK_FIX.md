# Dashboard Network Error Fix
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-04-20
Issue: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address network errors when loading the dashboard.
The issue manifests as "Error loading dashboard components. Attempting recovery..." followed by
NetworkError exceptions in the browser console.

## Root Causes

The identified root causes of the network errors are:

1. **HTTPS/SSL Connection Issues**: Problems with self-signed certificates and secure connection handling
2. **Network Request Timeout**: Insufficient timeout and retry mechanisms for API requests
3. **Error Recovery Mechanism**: Inadequate error handling for network failures
4. **Proxy Configuration**: Suboptimal proxy settings between frontend and backend

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard Loader

- Improved error detection for network errors
- Added progressive backoff for recovery attempts
- Enhanced caching and recovery mechanisms
- Added detailed error tracking through APP_CACHE

### 2. Network Resilience Improvements

- Enhanced `monitoredFetch` with retry logic and exponential backoff
- Added better timeout handling for network requests
- Improved error categorization and tracking

### 3. HTTPS Server Enhancements

- Optimized proxy configuration for API requests
- Added better error handling for proxy failures
- Implemented backend health checks
- Increased connection timeouts

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working properly:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend/pyfactor
   python run_server.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend server:
   ```
   cd frontend/pyfactor_next
   pnpm run dev:https
   ```

3. Open the application at https://localhost:3000
4. Sign in and verify the dashboard loads without network errors

## Troubleshooting

If network errors persist:

1. Check that the backend server is running at https://127.0.0.1:8000
2. Verify SSL certificates are valid in the `certificates` directory
3. Check browser console for specific error messages
4. Ensure both frontend and backend are using HTTPS

## Security Considerations

- No cookies or local storage are used
- Only Cognito Attributes and APP_CACHE are used for data storage
- Strict tenant isolation is maintained
- No hardcoded tenant IDs or sensitive information
