# Cookie Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Production users were unable to log in due to cookies not being set properly. The root cause was the incorrect use of `await cookies()` in Next.js API routes.

## Root Cause
According to CLAUDE.md [31.0.0], the `cookies()` function from `next/headers` should NOT be awaited in Next.js. This was causing cookies to not be set in the response headers, resulting in authentication failures.

## Fix Applied
1. Fixed 91 files across the entire `/src/app/api` directory
2. Removed `await` from all `cookies()` function calls
3. Pattern fixed: `const cookieStore = await cookies()` â†’ `const cookieStore = cookies()`

## Files Fixed
- All API routes in `/src/app/api/auth/*`
- All proxy routes
- All HR, payroll, and timesheet endpoints
- All user management endpoints
- All other API endpoints using cookies

## Testing Required
1. Test user login flow
2. Verify cookies are set correctly (sid and session_token)
3. Check that authenticated API calls work
4. Test session persistence across page refreshes

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit these changes with message: "fix: Remove await from cookies() calls per Next.js requirements"
2. Push to Dott_Main_Dev_Deploy branch
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor login success rates
