# Smart Insights Security Analysis

## Current Security Measures

### 1. API Key Protection ✅
- **Environment Variable**: API key stored as `SMART_INSIGHTS_CLAUDE_API_KEY`
- **Server-Side Only**: Key never exposed to client/browser
- **No Hardcoding**: Key not in source code

### 2. Authentication ✅
- **Session Required**: All requests require valid `sid` cookie
- **401 Response**: Unauthorized requests are rejected
- **Session Validation**: Integrates with existing auth system

### 3. Rate Limiting ✅
- **10 requests per minute** per session
- **429 Response**: Too many requests are rejected
- **Memory-based tracking**: Simple but effective for single instance

### 4. Input Validation ✅
- **Query Length**: Limited to 1000 characters
- **Type Checking**: Ensures query is a string
- **Sanitization**: Removes `<>` characters to prevent injection
- **Trimming**: Removes excess whitespace

### 5. Audit Trail ✅
- **Session Logging**: Logs session ID (truncated for privacy)
- **Query Metadata**: Logs query length and timestamp
- **Token Usage**: Tracks AI token consumption

### 6. Error Handling ✅
- **No Sensitive Data**: Error messages don't expose system details
- **Graceful Degradation**: Credit deduction failures don't break queries

## Security Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Move Rate Limiting to Redis**
   - Current in-memory approach doesn't work with multiple instances
   - Use Redis for distributed rate limiting

2. **Implement Credit System in Backend**
   - Currently credits are client-side only
   - Need database table for user credits
   - Prevent queries if no credits available

3. **Add Query Sanitization**
   - Implement more robust input sanitization
   - Consider using a library like DOMPurify

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Request Signing**
   - Sign requests to prevent tampering
   - Validate signatures server-side

2. **Implement Query History**
   - Store queries in database for audit
   - Allow users to see their query history

3. **Add Cost Controls**
   - Set daily/monthly limits per user
   - Alert on unusual usage patterns

### Low Priority
1. **Content Filtering**
   - Filter inappropriate queries
   - Implement business-only query validation

2. **Response Caching**
   - Cache common queries to reduce API calls
   - Reduce costs for repeated questions

## Best Practices Followed ✅

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: API key only has necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
3. **Fail Secure**: Errors don't expose sensitive info
4. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging
5. **Input Validation**: Never trust user input

## Potential Vulnerabilities

1. **In-Memory Rate Limiting**: Won't work with multiple server instances
2. **No Backend Credit Validation**: Users could manipulate client-side credits
3. **No Query History**: Can't audit what users asked
4. **No Cost Limits**: Users could consume excessive API credits

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: User queries may contain personal data
- **Data Retention**: Need policy for query/response storage
- **User Consent**: Should inform users AI is being used
- **Right to Delete**: Users should be able to delete query history

## Summary

The current implementation is **reasonably secure** for a MVP/initial release with:
- ✅ Protected API credentials
- ✅ Authenticated access only  
- ✅ Basic rate limiting
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Audit logging

However, before scaling or handling sensitive business data, implement:
- Backend credit system
- Distributed rate limiting
- Query history/audit trail
- Cost controls
