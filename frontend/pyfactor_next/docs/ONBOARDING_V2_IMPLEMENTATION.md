# Onboarding V2 Implementation

## Overview

The onboarding system has been upgraded to v2 with significant improvements in state management, error handling, and progress persistence. The new implementation addresses all the issues identified in the comprehensive flow analysis.

## Key Components

### 1. Session Manager V2 (`/src/utils/sessionManager.v2.js`)
- **Single Source of Truth**: Backend is authoritative, cookies are just transport
- **Automatic Retry**: Handles network failures with exponential backoff
- **Caching**: 5-minute cache to reduce API calls
- **Session Sync**: Automatic synchronization with backend

### 2. Onboarding State Machine (`/src/utils/onboardingStateMachine.js`)
- **Clear States**: NOT_STARTED → BUSINESS_INFO → SUBSCRIPTION_SELECTION → PAYMENT_PENDING → COMPLETED
- **Valid Transitions**: Enforces proper flow and prevents invalid state changes
- **Progress Persistence**: Saves state after each transition
- **Error Recovery**: Allows retry from ERROR state

### 3. Enhanced Error Handler V2 (`/src/utils/errorHandler.v2.js`)
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Maps technical errors to clear explanations
- **Recovery Actions**: Provides specific actions users can take
- **Error Categories**: AUTH, NETWORK, VALIDATION, PAYMENT, SESSION, ONBOARDING, SYSTEM
- **Retry Logic**: Determines which errors are retryable

### 4. API Client V2 (`/src/utils/apiClient.v2.js`)
- **Automatic Retry**: Retries failed requests with exponential backoff
- **Session Management**: Automatically includes auth headers
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout with proper cleanup
- **Error Parsing**: Extracts meaningful error information

### 5. Onboarding Flow V2 (`/src/components/Onboarding/OnboardingFlow.v2.jsx`)
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual representation of current step
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with recovery options
- **State Integration**: Uses state machine for flow control
- **Auto-Save**: Progress saved at each step

## Features Implemented

### 1. Progress Persistence
- Each step is saved to backend immediately
- Browser refresh resumes from last completed step
- Progress survives browser cache clear
- Network failures don't lose progress

### 2. Error Handling
- Network errors show "Check your connection" with retry
- Auth errors redirect to login with clear message
- Payment errors allow updating payment method
- All errors have recovery actions

### 3. State Management
- Free plan users complete immediately
- Paid plan users go through payment flow
- Payment failure returns to plan selection
- Completed users redirect to dashboard

### 4. Session Synchronization
- Backend is single source of truth
- Session updates are atomic
- Race conditions prevented
- Optimistic updates with rollback

## Migration Path

### To Enable V2:
```bash
node scripts/Version0003_update_onboarding_to_v2_onboarding_page.js
```

### To Rollback:
```bash
cp src/app/onboarding/page.v1.backup.js src/app/onboarding/page.js
```

## Testing Checklist

### New User Flow:
- [ ] Sign up → Direct to onboarding (no dashboard flash)
- [ ] Complete business info → Progress saved
- [ ] Select free plan → Complete immediately
- [ ] Select paid plan → Redirect to payment

### Existing User Flow:
- [ ] Sign in → Direct to dashboard
- [ ] Clear cache → Still go to dashboard
- [ ] Check business name displays correctly

### Error Recovery:
- [ ] Network failure → Shows retry option
- [ ] Payment failure → Returns to plan selection
- [ ] Session expiry → Redirects to login
- [ ] Invalid state → Shows clear error

### Progress Persistence:
- [ ] Refresh during business info → Resume at business info
- [ ] Refresh during plan selection → Resume at plan selection
- [ ] Close browser and return → Resume from last step
- [ ] Clear cache mid-flow → Resume from last step

## Security Improvements

### Session Management:
- Encrypted cookies (AES-256-CBC)
- CSRF protection with tokens
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)

### Error Handling:
- No sensitive data in error messages
- Generic errors for security failures
- Audit trail for security events
- Recovery without exposing system details

## Performance Improvements

### API Optimization:
- 5-minute session cache reduces API calls
- Batch updates where possible
- Optimistic UI updates
- Automatic retry prevents manual refreshes

### State Machine:
- O(1) state lookups
- Minimal state storage
- Efficient transition validation
- No unnecessary re-renders

## Next Steps

### High Priority:
1. Test with real users in staging
2. Monitor error rates and retry patterns
3. Gather feedback on UX improvements
4. Verify payment flow integration

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add session fingerprinting for security
2. Implement audit logging for compliance
3. Add analytics for onboarding funnel
4. Create admin tools for support

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check browser console for debug logs
- Error references (ERR-XXX) help support
- Session state visible in DevTools
- Backend logs have full context
