# This script will help resize the splash screen to have a smaller logo
echo "To resize your splash screen logo:"
echo "1. The splash.png should be 2732x2732px with the logo centered"
echo "2. The logo itself should be about 20-30% of the total size (500-800px)"
echo "3. Keep plenty of padding around the logo"
echo ""
echo "Recommended approach:"
echo "- Logo size: 600x600px in the center"
echo "- Background: Your gradient fills the entire 2732x2732px"
echo "- This gives a professional appearance with proper spacing"
