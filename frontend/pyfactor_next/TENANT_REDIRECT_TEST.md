# Tenant-Specific Dashboard Redirect Test

## ✅ YES - The fix handles tenant-specific redirects!

### How it works:

1. **User clears cache and signs in**
2. **Backend returns user data with `tenant_id`**
3. **establish-session route checks:**
   ```javascript
   // If user needs onboarding
   if (userData.needs_onboarding) {
     finalRedirectUrl = '/onboarding';
   }
   // If going to dashboard, add tenant ID
   else if (redirectUrl === '/dashboard' && userData.tenant_id) {
     finalRedirectUrl = `/${userData.tenant_id}/dashboard`;
   }
   ```
4. **User is redirected to their tenant-specific dashboard!**

### Test Cases Covered:

| Scenario | Initial URL | Has Tenant? | Needs Onboarding? | Final Redirect |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Existing user with tenant | `/dashboard` | ✅ `abc-123` | ❌ | `✅ /abc-123/dashboard` |
| New user needs onboarding | `/dashboard` | ❌ | ✅ | `✅ /onboarding` |
| Direct tenant URL | `/xyz-789/dashboard` | ✅ `xyz-789` | ❌ | `✅ /xyz-789/dashboard` |
| No tenant (shouldn't happen) | `/dashboard` | ❌ | ❌ | `⚠️ /dashboard` |

### Example Flow:

```
1. Jane from "TechCorp" (tenant: techcorp-555) clears her browser cache
2. She goes to dottapps.com and signs in
3. Auth0 authenticates her
4. Backend returns: 
   {
     email: "jane@techcorp.com",
     tenant_id: "techcorp-555",
     needs_onboarding: false,
     business_name: "TechCorp Inc"
   }
5. Session bridge submits to establish-session
6. Establish-session:
   - Sees redirectUrl = "/dashboard"
   - Sees tenant_id = "techcorp-555"
   - Changes to: "/techcorp-555/dashboard"
7. Jane lands on her company's dashboard! ✅
```

### To Test This:

1. **Clear all browser data**
2. **Sign in with a user that has a tenant**
3. **Check the Network tab:**
   - Look for `/api/auth/establish-session`
   - Check Response Headers > Location
   - Should show `/{tenant-id}/dashboard`
4. **Verify you land on the tenant dashboard**

### Console Logs to Expect:

```
[EstablishSession] Backend user data: {
  email: "user@company.com",
  tenantId: "company-123",
  needsOnboarding: false
}
[EstablishSession] Updated redirect URL to include tenant: /company-123/dashboard
[EstablishSession] Redirecting to: /company-123/dashboard
```

### Edge Cases Handled:

- ✅ User needs onboarding → Goes to `/onboarding`
- ✅ User has tenant → Goes to `/{tenant}/dashboard`
- ✅ URL already has tenant → Keeps existing URL
- ✅ No tenant (rare) → Falls back to `/dashboard`

The fix ensures users always go to the right place after clearing cache!
