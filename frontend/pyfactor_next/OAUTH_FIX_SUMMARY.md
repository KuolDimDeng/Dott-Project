# OAuth Flow Fix Summary
## Date: 2025-01-28 20:15:00

### Issues Fixed

1. **User bypassed onboarding**: OAuth users were being sent directly to dashboard without checking onboarding status
2. **Missing tenant ID**: Dashboard URL didn't include tenant ID after OAuth sign-in
3. **No attribute checking**: Direct OAuth wasn't checking Cognito custom attributes

### Solution Implemented

Created a two-step OAuth flow that properly checks user status:

#### Step 1: OAuth Callback (`/auth/callback-direct`)
- Exchanges authorization code for tokens
- Stores tokens in localStorage
- Redirects to OAuth success handler

#### Step 2: OAuth Success Handler (`/auth/oauth-success`)
- Checks if user exists in Cognito/Amplify
- Retrieves user attributes including:
  - `custom:onboarding` - Current onboarding step
  - `custom:tenant_ID` - Tenant identifier
  - `custom:setupdone` - Completion flag
- Redirects based on user status

### OAuth Flow Diagram

```
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
   ↓
2. Redirect to Google OAuth
   ↓
3. Google redirects to /auth/callback-direct
   ↓
4. Exchange code for tokens
   ↓
5. Redirect to /auth/oauth-success
   ↓
6. Check user status in Cognito
   ↓
7. Route based on status:
   - New user → /onboarding
   - Incomplete onboarding → /onboarding/[step]
   - Complete → /tenant/{id}/dashboard
```

### Redirect Logic

```javascript
if (onboardingStatus === 'complete' || setupDone) {
  // Fully onboarded user
  router.push(`/tenant/${tenantId}/dashboard?fromAuth=true`);
} else if (onboardingStatus) {
  // Partial onboarding
  switch(onboardingStatus) {
    case 'business_info': router.push('/onboarding/subscription');
    case 'subscription': router.push('/onboarding/subscription');
    case 'payment': router.push('/onboarding/setup');
    case 'setup': router.push('/onboarding/setup');
  }
} else {
  // New user
  router.push('/onboarding');
}
```

### Files Modified

1. `/src/app/auth/callback-direct/page.js` - Simplified to just handle token exchange
2. `/src/app/auth/oauth-success/page.js` - New page that checks user status

### Testing

After deployment:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Sign in with Google
3. Should see "Completing authentication..." then "Checking account status..."
4. New users → Onboarding flow
5. Existing users → Dashboard with tenant ID in URL

### Key Improvements

- ✅ Proper onboarding status checking for OAuth users
- ✅ Tenant ID included in dashboard URL
- ✅ Consistent behavior between email and OAuth sign-in
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback
