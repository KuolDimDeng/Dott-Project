# Google OAuth Sign-In Fix

## Issue Identified
Google sign-in is failing with `token_exchange_failed` error due to Auth0 configuration issues.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
The Auth0 token exchange is failing because the `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` is not properly configured in the production environment.

### 2. Redirect URI Mismatch  
Auth0 application is likely configured with different redirect URIs than what the application is trying to use.

## Current OAuth Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" 
2. Redirects to `/api/auth/login?connection=google-oauth2`
3. Auth0 redirects to `/auth/oauth-callback` with authorization code
4. Frontend calls `/api/auth/exchange` to exchange code for tokens
5. **FAILS HERE** - Token exchange fails due to missing client secret or redirect URI mismatch

## Required Fixes

### 1. Environment Variables (Render Dashboard)
Add these environment variables in Render:

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-auth0-client-secret>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=auth.dottapps.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=9i7GSU4bgh6hFtMXnQACwiRxTudpuOSF
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://api.dottapps.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://dottapps.com
```

### 2. Auth0 Application Configuration
In Auth0 Dashboard (https://manage.auth0.com):

1. **Allowed Callback URLs**:
   ```
   https://dottapps.com/auth/oauth-callback,
   https://dottapps.com/api/auth/callback
   ```

2. **Allowed Logout URLs**:
   ```
   https://dottapps.com/auth/signin,
   https://dottapps.com
   ```

3. **Allowed Web Origins**:
   ```
   https://dottapps.com
   ```

4. **Application Type**: Single Page Application
5. **Token Endpoint Authentication Method**: POST
6. **Grant Types**: Authorization Code, Refresh Token

### 3. Google Connection Configuration
1. Go to Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Social
2. Enable Google connection
3. Configure Google OAuth credentials
4. Ensure connection is enabled for your application

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Environment Variables
```bash
curl -X GET "https://dottapps.com/api/auth/test-config"
```

### 2. Test OAuth Flow
1. Click "Sign in with Google"
2. Check browser network tab for any errors
3. Verify redirect URLs match Auth0 configuration

### 3. Debug Logs
Check Render logs for detailed error messages from `/api/auth/exchange`

## Alternative Solution (If OAuth Continues to Fail)

If Google OAuth continues to have issues, you can temporarily disable it by:

1. **Hide Google Button**: Comment out the Google sign-in button in `EmailPasswordSignIn.js`
2. **Email/Password Only**: Users can still sign in with email/password
3. **Add Google Later**: Once configuration is fixed, re-enable Google sign-in

## Priority: HIGH
This affects user onboarding and authentication flow. Should be fixed immediately.

## Implementation Status
- [ ] Add missing environment variables in Render
- [ ] Update Auth0 application configuration  
- [ ] Test Google OAuth flow
- [ ] Verify token exchange works
- [ ] Update documentation

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/api/auth/exchange/route.js` - Enhanced error logging
- `/src/components/auth/EmailPasswordSignIn.js` - Better error handling

## Expected Result
After fix: Google sign-in should work smoothly, redirecting users to dashboard after successful authentication.
