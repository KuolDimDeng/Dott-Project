# Fixing Dynamic Imports in Next.js

## Problem

The application was encountering the following error:

```
SyntaxError: import declarations may only appear at top level of a module
    NextJS 4
    <anonymous> webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./src/lib/axiosConfig.js:13
```

This error occurred because certain server-only modules (like `next/headers`) were being dynamically imported inside client components, but Next.js doesn't allow for dynamic imports of server modules in client context during client-side rendering.

## Root Causes

1. Dynamic imports of server-only modules like `next/headers` in client components
2. Mixing server-only and client-only code in the same files
3. Using dynamic imports in a way that wasn't compatible with Next.js's module resolution system

## Files Fixed

The following files were modified to resolve the issue:

1. `/src/utils/tokenUtils.js`: Removed dynamic imports of `next/headers` and simplified server-side token handling
2. `/src/utils/tenantUtils.js`: Removed dynamic imports of `next/headers` and simplified server-side token handling
3. `/src/hooks/auth.js`: Replaced dynamic imports of `enhancedSignIn` and other functions with static references
4. `/next.config.js`: Removed deprecated `swcMinify` option

## Solution

1. **Removed dynamic imports of server-only modules**
   - Simplified server-side functions to avoid dynamic imports
   - Used conditional logic to return fallback values on the server

2. **Created utility for safer dynamic imports**
   - Added `importDebugger.js` utility with safer import helpers
   - Provides wrapper functions to handle import errors gracefully

3. **Prefer static imports over dynamic imports**
   - Where possible, used static imports instead of dynamic imports
   - Added wrapper functions to prevent server/client code mixing

## Best Practices

1. **Server/Client Separation**
   - Keep server-only code in separate files from client code
   - Use the 'use server' directive for server components
   - Use the 'use client' directive for client components

2. **Safe Dynamic Imports**
   - Always check for browser environment before dynamic imports
   - Use the safe import utility for error handling
   - Add fallbacks for when imports fail

```javascript
// Instead of this:
const module = await import('module');

// Do this:
let module = null;
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  try {
    module = await import('module');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load module:', error);
  }
}
```

3. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Keep webpack configuration minimal and focused
   - Use Next.js App Router features for better code splitting

## Testing

To ensure the fix works correctly:

1. Run the development server: `pnpm run dev`
2. Verify dynamic imports work correctly in client components
3. Check that server-only modules are properly handled
4. Rebuild and verify production build: `pnpm run build`
