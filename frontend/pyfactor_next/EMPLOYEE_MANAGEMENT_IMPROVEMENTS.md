Comprehensive improvements to the Employee Management page to meet industry standards for HR systems, with focus on legal compliance, user experience, and data integrity.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. **Legal Compliance - Employee Data Retention**

- **Real-time Updates**: Filter counts update automatically
- **Combined Filtering**: Works with search functionality

### 3. **Enhanced Edit Functionality**
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging for all edit operations
- **Status Mapping**: Properly maps `status` field to backend `active` boolean
- **Field Validation**: Ensures all required fields are validated
- **Success Feedback**: Clear toast notifications on successful updates

### 4. **Improved View Functionality**

### 5. **User Experience Improvements**

### 6. **Industry-Standard Features Added**

- **Supervisor Hierarchy**: Clear indication of supervisory roles
- **Payroll Integration**: Direct deposit and vacation time tracking
- **Status History**: Prepared for future audit trail implementation

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
```javascript
// Update employee with proper status handling
const result = await hrApi.employees.update(selectedEmployee.id, {
  ...backendData,
  active: backendData.status === 'active', // Map status to active boolean
  status: backendData.status
});
```

### Logging Strategy
```javascript
logger.info('ðŸ”„ [EmployeeManagement] Status changed:', {
  from: formData.status,
  to: e.target.value
});
```

### Filter Implementation
```javascript
// Combined status and search filtering
let filtered = employees;
if (statusFilter !== 'all') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(employee => employee.status === statusFilter);
}
if (searchTerm) {
  // Search across multiple fields
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Status Updates**
   - Create new employee â†’ Should be active
   - Edit employee â†’ Change to inactive â†’ Verify update
   - Filter by inactive â†’ Should show deactivated employee

2. **Test View Functionality**
   - Click view on active employee â†’ See normal details
   - Click view on inactive employee â†’ See inactive banner
   - Verify all fields display correctly

3. **Test Search & Filter**
   - Search for employee name with status filter active
   - Clear search â†’ Filter should remain
   - Change filter â†’ Search should remain

## Future Enhancements (Recommended)

1. **Audit Trail**: Track who made changes and when
2. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple employees for status updates
3. **Export Functionality**: Export filtered employee lists
4. **Advanced Filters**: Department, hire date range, etc.
5. **Employee Self-Service**: Allow employees to update some fields
6. **Termination Workflow**: Proper offboarding process
7. **Document Management**: Store employee documents
8. **Integration**: Sync with payroll and benefits systems

## Migration Notes

- No database changes required
- Existing delete functionality removed (backend can retain for now)
- All employees should have proper status field set
- Consider running migration to ensure all employees have active/inactive status

## Security Considerations

- SSN/Tax ID fields never populated when editing (security best practice)
- Employee records retained for compliance
- Proper permission checks before allowing edits
- Audit logging recommended for all changes
