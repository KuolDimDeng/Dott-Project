# Render 2GB Memory Build Solution

## Problem
The Next.js 15 build is failing on Render with "JavaScript heap out of memory" errors despite having 2GB of memory allocated. The current configuration includes heavy features like PWA, Sentry integration, and complex webpack optimizations.

## Root Causes
1. **Next.js 15 Memory Usage**: Next.js 15 uses significantly more memory during builds
2. **Heavy Dependencies**: PWA, Sentry, and other integrations add memory overhead
3. **Webpack Optimizations**: Complex chunking and optimization strategies consume memory
4. **Parallel Processing**: Default parallel builds consume more memory

## Tested Solutions (All Failed Locally)
1. Minimal config with disabled features - Still ran out of memory at 1536MB
2. Ultra-minimal config with all optimizations disabled - Failed
3. Chunked build approach - Failed due to font loader issues
4. Progressive memory limits - All failed up to 2048MB

## Recommended Solution for Render

### Option 1: Use a Pre-built Docker Image
Instead of building on Render, build locally and push a pre-built Docker image:

```bash
# Build locally with high memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm build

# Create a runtime-only Dockerfile
cat > Dockerfile.prebuilt << 'EOF'
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@8.10.0 --activate
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile
COPY .next ./.next
COPY public ./public
COPY next.config.js ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
EOF

# Build and push to Docker Hub
docker build -f Dockerfile.prebuilt -t yourusername/dott-frontend:latest .
docker push yourusername/dott-frontend:latest
```

Then on Render, use the pre-built image instead of building from source.

### Option 2: Upgrade Render Plan
- Upgrade to a 4GB RAM instance temporarily for builds
- After successful build, downgrade back to 2GB for runtime
- Render charges pro-rated, so cost impact is minimal

### Option 3: Use External Build Service
Use GitHub Actions or another CI/CD service to build and deploy:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Build and Deploy to Render
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8.10.0
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm build
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          path: .next
```

### Option 4: Temporary Build Configuration
Create a special config that temporarily disables all non-essential features:

```javascript
// next.config.render-build.js
module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: false,
  typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true },
  eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true },
  // Minimal config for build only
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.optimization.minimize = false;
    return config;
  },
};
```

Then after build, restore full config for runtime.

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **For Quick Deployment**: Use Option 2 - Temporarily upgrade to 4GB on Render
2. **For Long-term**: Implement Option 1 - Pre-built Docker images
3. **For Cost Optimization**: Implement Option 3 - External build service

## Build Command for Render (If Continuing with 2GB)

Update your Render build command to:

```bash
# Clear caches and use minimal memory
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache && \
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=1800 --gc-interval=100" \
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 \
pnpm build
```

## Environment Variables to Set on Render

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1800
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Notes
- The application requires more than 2GB to build with current configuration
- Disabling features significantly impacts functionality
- Pre-building or using external services is the most reliable solution
