# Cognito Network Error Fixes

## Issue
The application was experiencing authentication errors and network failures when connecting to AWS Cognito, resulting in:
- "Auth UserPool not configured" errors
- Unhandled authentication failures
- Repeated failed network requests

## Fix Implementation (v1.0)
Applied on: 2025-04-19T21:53:37.164Z

### Enhanced Amplify Configuration
- Added force reconfiguration option to recover from broken state
- Improved initialization checks to ensure Amplify is properly configured
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Created a dedicated AuthInitializer component

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Implemented circuit breaker for Cognito requests to prevent cascading failures
- Three states: CLOSED (normal), OPEN (blocking requests), HALF-OPEN (testing recovery)
- Automatic recovery after timeout period
- Manual reset on important user navigation paths

### Middleware Enhancements
- Reset circuit breaker for critical paths (auth, dashboard)
- Improved error handling for tenant isolation

## Usage
The fixes are automatically applied through the application's startup process. No manual steps are required.

## Monitoring
Monitor the console logs for the following patterns:
- "[AmplifyUnified] Auth configuration applied successfully" - Indicates successful initialization
- "[CircuitBreaker] Cognito circuit transitioned to..." - Shows circuit breaker state changes
- "[AuthInitializer] Auth configuration applied successfully" - Confirms component initialization

## Troubleshooting
If authentication issues persist:
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check AWS Cognito service status
3. Verify environment variables for AWS configuration
4. Check network connectivity to AWS services
