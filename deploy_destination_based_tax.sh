Implement destination-based taxation with location dropdowns

Major changes:
- Add destination-based tax calculation using customer shipping address
- Add county fields to Customer, Product, and UserProfile models
- Add tax exemption fields for customers and products
- Implement location dropdown APIs for countries, states, and counties
- Update Customer Management and POS to use location dropdowns
- Add tax jurisdiction tracking to POS transactions
- Show tax breakdown (state + county) in POS interface

Backend:
- Created TaxService for destination-based tax calculations
- Added tax calculation hierarchy: shipping ‚Üí billing ‚Üí origin
- Added location data API endpoints from GlobalSalesTaxRate
- Added database migrations for new fields

Frontend:
- Converted all location inputs to cascading dropdowns
- Added shipping address toggle in POS
- Show tax jurisdiction details in POS
- Pre-fetch location data when editing customers

This ensures accurate tax calculations based on customer location
and prevents spelling errors through standardized dropdowns.
