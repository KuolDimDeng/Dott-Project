# Currency API 500 Error Debug Summary

## What We've Done

### 1. **Created Debug Endpoints** (Backend)
- `/api/currency/debug-500/` - Step-by-step debugging to find where 500 error occurs
- `/api/currency/preferences-simple/` - Simplified endpoint with basic auth
- `/api/currency/minimal/` - Ultra-minimal endpoint bypassing most middleware

### 2. **Created Debug Tools** (Frontend)
- `/test-currency-debug.html` - Comprehensive debug testing page
- Shows exactly where in the request chain the error occurs

### 3. **Files Created/Modified**
```
Backend:
- /backend/pyfactor/users/api/currency_debug.py
- /backend/pyfactor/users/api/currency_views_simple.py
- /backend/pyfactor/users/api/currency_minimal.py
- /backend/pyfactor/users/urls.py (added new endpoints)

Frontend:
- /frontend/pyfactor_next/public/test-currency-debug.html
```

## How to Use the Debug Tools

1. **Access the debug page** (after deployment):
   ```
   https://app.dottapps.com/test-currency-debug.html
   ```

2. **Run tests in order**:
   - Click "Debug 500 Error" - This shows exactly which step fails
   - Click "Test Minimal Endpoint" - Tests basic connectivity
   - Click "Test Simple Endpoint" - Tests with authentication
   - Click "Test Original Endpoint" - Tests the actual currency API

## What the 500 Error Likely Is

Based on the error occurring at the backend level, it's likely one of:

1. **Import Error** - A module failing to import (accounting_standards, currency_data, etc.)
2. **Database Access** - Issue with UserProfile or Business model queries
3. **Middleware Issue** - One of the many middleware layers causing problems
4. **Permission/Auth Issue** - The authentication system not working as expected

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these debug tools** (when ready)
2. **Run the debug tests** to see exactly where the failure occurs
3. **Fix the specific issue** based on what the debug reveals
4. **Test currency persistence** once the 500 error is fixed

## Key Insights

- The frontend is now properly reporting backend errors (no more masking)
- The database columns exist (confirmed via SQL)
- The issue is in the Django backend request handling

## Deployment Command

When ready to deploy:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add currency API debug tools to diagnose 500 error"
git push origin main
```

Then wait 5-10 minutes for Render to deploy and test at the debug URL.
