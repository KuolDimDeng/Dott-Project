# Final Authentication Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `withCredentials` in Axios Configuration
**Problem**: API calls weren't sending cookies because axios instances lacked `withCredentials: true`
**Fix**: Added `withCredentials: true` to both `axiosInstance` and `serverAxiosInstance` in `/src/lib/axiosConfig.js`

### 2. User Profile API Returning 401 Errors
**Problem**: The `/api/user/profile` endpoint was still looking for the old cookie name `appSession`
**Fix**: Updated to check for both `dott_auth_session` and `appSession` cookies

### 3. Missing Business Name in DashAppBar
**Problem**: Business name wasn't being stored in the session cookie, causing it to be missing from the UI
**Fix**: 
- Updated `/api/auth/update-session` to accept and store `businessName` and `businessType`
- Modified `authFlowHandler` to pass business info when updating the session
- This ensures business data from the backend is persisted in the session

## All Endpoints Updated

Complete list of API endpoints now using the new secure cookie:
- ✅ `/api/auth/profile`
- ✅ `/api/auth/update-session`
- ✅ `/api/auth/access-token`
- ✅ `/api/auth/refresh-session`
- ✅ `/api/auth/session`
- ✅ `/api/auth/me`
- ✅ `/api/user/profile`
- ✅ `/api/onboarding/complete-all`
- ✅ `/api/user/close-account`
- ✅ `/api/user/update-onboarding-status`
- ✅ `/api/user/create-auth0-user`
- ✅ `/api/backend/[...path]`

## Security Improvements

1. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Prevents JavaScript access to session tokens
2. **Secure Flag**: Cookies only sent over HTTPS in production
3. **SameSite=Lax**: Provides CSRF protection
4. **Cross-subdomain Support**: Works between app and API domains
5. **No localStorage**: Eliminates XSS token theft risk

## Data Flow

1. User signs in → Auth0 authentication
2. Session created with `dott_auth_session` cookie
3. Profile data fetched from backend (includes business info)
4. Session updated with business info via `update-session` endpoint
5. All subsequent requests include the secure cookie
6. DashAppBar and other components can access business name from session

## Deployment Status

All fixes have been deployed:
- Commit 1: `81304f46` - Fixed API endpoints to use new cookie
- Commit 2: `3002dedb` - Fixed axios configuration
- Commit 3: `0c39341e` - Fixed user profile endpoint
- Commit 4: `3e20b859` - Fixed business name in session

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Sign in with email/password
2. ✅ Session persists (no redirect to login)
3. ✅ API calls authenticated (no 401 errors)
4. ✅ Business name displays in DashAppBar
5. ✅ Profile data loads correctly
6. ✅ Cookies are HttpOnly and Secure

## What's Fixed

1. ✅ "No Auth0 session found" errors
2. ✅ Session persistence issues
3. ✅ API authentication failures (401 errors)
4. ✅ Missing business name in UI
5. ✅ Profile data not loading

The authentication system is now fully functional with secure cookie-based sessions.
