/**
 * Fix for React Key Spread Warning in EmployeeManagement.js
 * Version: 1.0
 * Date: 2025-04-27
 * Issue: React was warning about keys being spread into JSX elements
 * File Fixed: src/app/dashboard/components/forms/EmployeeManagement.js
 * 
 * Details:
 * - The issue was in the table header rendering in the renderEmployeesList function
 * - React requires keys to be passed directly to JSX elements rather than being included in a spread object
 * - The error occurred at line 1600-1601 with: <th {...column.getHeaderProps(column.getSortByToggleProps())} />
 * - Fixed by extracting the key and passing it directly: <th key={key} {...columnProps} />
 * 
 * Fix implementation:
 * 1. Extracted the 'key' property from the props object
 * 2. Passed the key directly to the JSX element
 * 3. Spread the remaining props separately
 * 
 * Example of the fix:
 * Before:
 * <th {...column.getHeaderProps(column.getSortByToggleProps())} className="..." />
 * 
 * After:
 * const { key, ...columnProps } = column.getHeaderProps(column.getSortByToggleProps());
 * <th key={key} {...columnProps} className="..." />
