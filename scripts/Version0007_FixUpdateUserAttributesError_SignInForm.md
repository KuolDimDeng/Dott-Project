# Version0007_FixUpdateUserAttributesError_SignInForm

## Issue Description
This script addresses the issue where the dashboard is not loading with the tenant ID in the URL after user sign-in. The error occurs during the sign-in process when attempting to update user attributes:

```
[SignInForm] Error fetching user attributes: TypeError: can't convert undefined to object
    toAttributeType webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../../node_modules/.pnpm/@aws-amplify+auth@6.12.1_@aws-amplify+core@6.11.1/node_modules/@aws-amplify/auth/dist/esm/providers/cognito/utils/apiHelpers.mjs:14
    updateUserAttributes webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../../node_modules/.pnpm/@aws-amplify+auth@6.12.1_@aws-amplify+core@6.11.1/node_modules/@aws-amplify/auth/dist/esm/providers/cognito/apis/updateUserAttributes.mjs:60
```

After this error, the system redirects to `/dashboard` without a tenant ID (`tenantId: null`), resulting in a generic dashboard instead of the tenant-specific dashboard.

### Root Cause
1. The `updateUserAttributes` function in the SignInForm.js file is being called without proper null checks, causing a TypeError when the user object is undefined.
2. The tenant ID retrieval logic in the `getTenantIdFromSources` function is not comprehensive enough to find the tenant ID from all possible sources.
3. When an error occurs during user attribute fetching, the system falls back to redirecting without a tenant ID.

### Fix Applied
The script makes the following changes:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling for updateUserAttributes**:
   - Added proper null checks before accessing userAttributes
   - Wrapped the updateUserAttributes call in a try-catch block to prevent the error from interrupting the sign-in flow
   - Ensures the fixed status is still used in memory even if the update to Cognito fails

2. **Improved Tenant ID Retrieval**:
   - Enhanced the `getTenantIdFromSources` function to check multiple sources for the tenant ID:
     - APP_CACHE
     - sessionStorage
     - URL path
     - Cognito user attributes (checking multiple attribute names)
     - Auth session claims
   - Added detailed logging to track where the tenant ID is found
   - Improved error handling to continue checking other sources if one fails

3. **Better Error Recovery**:
   - When there's an error fetching user attributes, the system now attempts to resolve the tenant ID before redirecting
   - Added logging to track the resolved tenant ID after an error

## Implementation Details

### Changes to SignInForm.js
- Added proper null checks and error handling for the `updateUserAttributes` call
- Enhanced the `getTenantIdFromSources` function to be more robust
- Improved error recovery to ensure tenant ID is included in redirects when possible
- Added detailed logging to track tenant ID resolution

### Security Considerations
- No hardcoded tenant IDs are used
- The implementation maintains strict tenant isolation
- No sensitive information is exposed in the process
- All error handling is properly logged
