# Version0011_FixInvalidHookCall_EmployeeManagement

## Issue Description
This script fixes the invalid hook call error in the EmployeeManagement component that occurred after implementing the tabbed interface. The error message was:

```
Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
```

The error occurred because the `useState` hook for managing the active tab was placed inside a nested function (within a `useEffect` callback) instead of at the top level of the component.

### Root Cause
In React, hooks must be called at the top level of a function component, not inside nested functions, conditions, or loops. This is one of the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/link/invalid-hook-call) enforced by React.

The implementation incorrectly placed the `activeTab` state declaration inside a nested function context, violating this rule.

### Fix Applied
The script moves the `useState` hook declaration for the `activeTab` state from inside the nested function to the top level of the component, alongside the other state declarations. This ensures that the hook is called according to React's rules.

## Implementation Details

### Changes to EmployeeManagement.js
- Removed the `useState` hook declaration from inside the nested function
- Added the `useState` hook declaration at the top level of the component with the other state declarations
- Maintained the same initial state value ('list') and naming convention

### Technical Approach
- Followed React's Rules of Hooks by ensuring hooks are only called at the top level
- Maintained the existing functionality of the tabbed interface
- Ensured no other code was affected by this change
