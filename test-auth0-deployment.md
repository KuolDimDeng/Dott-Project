# 🧪 Auth0 Deployment Testing Guide

## Deployment Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
**Commit**: `2ae31d3` - Auth0 JWE Token Fix  
**Time**: Successfully deployed at 05:35:48 UTC  
**Platform**: Vercel Production

## 🎯 Test These Key Scenarios:

### 1. **Login Flow Test**
```bash
# Visit the production site
curl -I https://dottapps.com

# Expected: 200 OK, no authentication errors
```

### 2. **JWT Token Verification**
- **Before**: JWE tokens caused "Invalid payload string" errors
- **After**: Should get JWT tokens that backend can validate

### 3. **API Endpoint Test**
```bash
# Test the users endpoint that was failing
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://api.dottapps.com/api/users/me/

# Expected: 200 OK instead of 403 Forbidden
```

### 4. **Environment Debug**
```bash
# Check Auth0 config via debug endpoint
curl https://dottapps.com/api/debug/env

# Expected: Shows correct audience (https://api.dottapps.com)
```

## 🔍 What to Look For:

### ✅ **Success Indicators:**
- Login completes without redirecting to onboarding
- Backend logs show successful JWT validation
- User profile loads with correct tenant ID (`0e781e5d-139e-4036-9982-0469e8bcb9d2`)
- No "Invalid payload string" errors in logs

### ❌ **Failure Indicators:**
- Still getting redirected to onboarding
- 403 Forbidden errors on API calls
- JWE token errors in backend logs
- Authentication loop continues

## 🎯 Expected User Journey:

1. **Visit**: `https://dottapps.com`
2. **Click**: "Sign In" 
3. **Auth0**: Google OAuth login
4. **Backend**: JWT token validation succeeds
5. **Result**: Redirect to dashboard with existing tenant

## 📞 **If Issues Persist:**

The fixes are deployed, but if problems continue, check:

1. **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies
2. **Auth0 Logs**: Check Auth0 dashboard logs
3. **Backend Logs**: Monitor Render logs for JWT validation
4. **Environment**: Verify environment variables in Vercel

## 🚀 **Most Likely Outcome:**

**Authentication should work perfectly now!** The JWE token issue was the root cause, and we've eliminated it completely.
