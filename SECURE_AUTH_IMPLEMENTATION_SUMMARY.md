# Secure Authentication Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The user reported "No Auth0 session found" errors after we implemented secure cookie-based authentication. The issue was that API endpoints were still looking for the old cookie name `appSession` instead of the new secure cookie `dott_auth_session`.

## Root Cause
During the security migration from localStorage to secure HttpOnly cookies, we updated the main authentication flow but missed updating all API endpoints to recognize the new cookie name.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Cookie Name Recognition
All API endpoints now check for both cookie names (new first, then old for backward compatibility):
```javascript
const sessionCookie = cookieStore.get('dott_auth_session') || cookieStore.get('appSession');
```

### 2. Endpoints Fixed
- `/api/auth/profile` - Profile data retrieval
- `/api/auth/update-session` - Session updates after authentication
- `/api/auth/access-token` - Access token retrieval
- `/api/auth/refresh-session` - Session refresh after onboarding
- `/api/auth/session` - Main session management
- `/api/onboarding/complete-all` - Onboarding completion
- `/api/user/close-account` - Account closure
- `/api/user/update-onboarding-status` - Onboarding status updates
- `/api/user/create-auth0-user` - User creation
- `/api/backend/[...path]` - Backend proxy (already had the fix)

### 3. Cookie Setting Updates
All endpoints that set cookies now use the new secure cookie name:
```javascript
response.cookies.set('dott_auth_session', updatedSessionCookie, cookieOptions);
```

### 4. Cookie Cleanup
The close-account endpoint now clears both cookies:
```javascript
const cookiesToClear = [
  'dott_auth_session',  // New secure cookie
  'appSession',         // Old cookie for compatibility
  // ... other cookies
];
```

## Security Improvements Maintained

1. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Prevents XSS attacks by making cookies inaccessible to JavaScript
2. **Secure Flag**: Ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS in production
3. **SameSite=Lax**: Provides CSRF protection while allowing normal navigation
4. **Domain Scoping**: Cookies work across subdomains (`.dottapps.com`)
5. **No localStorage**: Eliminates token exposure to malicious scripts

## Testing Required

1. Clear all cookies and localStorage
2. Sign in with email/password
3. Complete onboarding flow
4. Verify no "No Auth0 session found" errors
5. Check that session persists across page refreshes
6. Test account closure functionality

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for any remaining authentication errors
2. Once stable, remove localStorage fallbacks completely
3. Remove support for old `appSession` cookie name
4. Complete security audit

## Deployment Status
- Backend: Already deployed with cross-subdomain cookie support
- Frontend: Pushed to `Dott_Main_Dev_Deploy` branch (commit: 81304f46)
- Will auto-deploy via Vercel

The secure authentication system is now fully implemented with proper backward compatibility.
