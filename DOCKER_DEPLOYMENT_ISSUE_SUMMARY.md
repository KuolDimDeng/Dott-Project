# Docker Deployment Issue Summary - AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Current Status
- **Environment**: DottApp-prod
- **Platform**: Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023/4.5.2
- **Health**: Severe (Red)
- **Error**: "The Docker container unexpectedly ended after it was started"

## Issue Description
The Docker container is crashing immediately after starting on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The deployment fails with "Engine execution has encountered an error" and the container exits unexpectedly.

## Fixes Attempted

### 1. Initial Docker Fix (`fix-docker-crash.sh`)
- Added health app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings_eb.py
- Updated URLs to include health endpoint
- Created health check middleware
- Created simplified Dockerfile with debugging
- Updated .ebextensions configuration

### 2. Configuration Fixes
- Updated EB configuration to use DottApp application instead of Dott
- Removed invalid static files configuration from .ebextensions
- Created nginx configuration for static files

### 3. Proper Docker Fix (`proper-docker-fix.sh`)
- Created minimal requirements with only essential packages
- Added comprehensive startup script with error handling
- Removed problematic Dockerrun.aws.json
- Updated .ebignore to exclude unnecessary files

### 4. Final Emergency Fix (`final-emergency-fix.sh`)
- Created comprehensive requirements-eb.txt with ALL dependencies
- Added better error handling in Dockerfile
- Included environment variables for database connection
- Added extended timeout settings
- Created platform hooks for additional setup

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be related to one or more of the following:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: The application may require dependencies not included in requirements-eb.txt
2. **Django Configuration**: The settings_eb.py file may have configuration issues
3. **File Structure**: Critical files may not be properly copied into the Docker container
4. **Environment Variables**: Required environment variables may not be set correctly
5. **Database Connection**: The application may be failing to connect to the RDS database

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Debug Using Local Docker
```bash
# Build and run locally to see actual error
docker build -t pyfactor-test .
docker run -p 8000:8000 pyfactor-test
```

### Option 2: Create Minimal Working Application
Create a completely minimal Django application that only has a health check endpoint to verify the deployment process works, then gradually add components.

### Option 3: Use EB Logs
```bash
# Set up SSH access
eb ssh --setup

# SSH into instance
eb ssh

# Check logs
sudo docker logs $(sudo docker ps -aq)
sudo cat /var/log/eb-engine.log
```

### Option 4: Switch to ZIP Deployment
Instead of using Docker, consider deploying as a Python application:
1. Change platform to "Python 3.12 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023"
2. Deploy without Docker configuration

## Recommendations

1. **Test Locally First**: Always test the Docker container locally before deploying
2. **Start Minimal**: Begin with the absolute minimum working configuration
3. **Add Logging**: Add extensive logging to understand where the failure occurs
4. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are in requirements-eb.txt
5. **Verify Settings**: Double-check that settings_eb.py has all required configurations
