# Deployment Guide - Nginx Fix Applied

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Ensure Changes are Committed
The nginx reload fix has been committed with message:
```
fix: Remove nginx reload commands causing deployment failure
```

### 2. Push to Repository
```bash
git push origin Dott_Main_Dev_Deploy
```

### 3. Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk

#### Option A: Using the Deployment Script (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy-to-eb.sh
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment with EB CLI
```bash
cd backend/pyfactor
eb deploy DottApp-simple
```

#### Option C: Manual Deployment with AWS Console
1. Go to AWS Elastic Beanstalk console
2. Select application: DottApp
3. Select environment: DottApp-simple
4. Click "Upload and Deploy"
5. Upload the latest version from your local directory

### 4. Monitor Deployment
- Watch the deployment progress in the AWS console
- Check the Events tab for real-time updates
- The deployment should complete without nginx reload errors

### 5. Verify Deployment
Once deployment is complete:
- Check health status: Should be "Ok" (green)
- Test health endpoint: https://DottApp-simple.eba-dua2f3pi.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/health/
- Check application logs if needed

## What Was Fixed
- Removed problematic `01_reload_nginx` command from container_commands
- Nginx configuration is now properly handled by Elastic Beanstalk
- Platform automatically reloads nginx when configuration changes

## Troubleshooting
If deployment still fails:
1. Check CloudWatch logs: `/aws/elasticbeanstalk/DottApp-simple/var/log/eb-engine.log`
2. Use EB CLI to get logs: `eb logs DottApp-simple`
3. SSH to instance: `eb ssh DottApp-simple`

## Success Indicators
- No "Command 01_reload_nginx failed" errors
- Deployment completes successfully
- Health status shows "Ok"
- Health endpoint returns proper response
