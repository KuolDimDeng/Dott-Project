# Geofencing Workflow Verification

## Summary
Yes, the employee-geofence assignments are properly saved in the backend and the PWA mobile clock-in correctly validates against assigned geofences. Here's how the complete workflow operates:

## 1. Employee-Geofence Assignment Persistence

### Backend Models
- **Geofence Model** (`hr/models.py`): Stores geofence details including location, radius, and enforcement rules
- **EmployeeGeofence Model** (`hr/models.py`): Many-to-many relationship between employees and geofences
  - Includes `is_active` field for soft deletion
  - Tracks `assigned_at` timestamp and `assigned_by` user
  - Has `can_clock_in_outside` override permission

### Assignment Process
1. Admin creates geofence in Settings → Geofencing
2. Admin assigns wage employees using inline form
3. Backend API endpoint `/api/hr/geofences/{id}/assign_employees/` saves assignments
4. Assignments stored in `hr_employeegeofence` table with proper tenant isolation

## 2. PWA Mobile Clock-In Validation

### Location Check Flow
1. **Employee Opens Clock-In Page**: 
   - Frontend requests user's GPS location
   - Checks location consent status
   - Shows consent modal if needed

2. **Geofence Validation**:
   - Frontend calls `/api/hr/geofences/check_location/` with:
     - `latitude` and `longitude` from GPS
     - `employee_id` from session
   - Backend calculates distance using Haversine formula
   - Returns list of assigned geofences with status

3. **Clock-In Permission Logic**:
   ```javascript
   // Employee can clock in if:
   // 1. No geofences assigned (can_clock_in = true)
   // 2. Inside at least one assigned geofence
   // 3. Has can_clock_in_outside override permission
   ```

## 3. Backend API Endpoints

### Key Endpoints
- `GET /api/hr/geofences/` - List all geofences
- `POST /api/hr/geofences/{id}/assign_employees/` - Assign employees
- `GET /api/hr/geofences/check_location/` - Validate employee location

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "employee_id": "uuid",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194
  },
  "geofences": [
    {
      "geofence": { /* geofence details */ },
      "is_inside": true,
      "distance": 150.5,
      "distance_from_edge": 49.5,
      "can_clock_in": true
    }
  ],
  "can_clock_in": true
}
```

## 4. Frontend Implementation

### Key Components Updated
1. **EnhancedClockInOut.js**:
   - Fixed API endpoint from POST to GET
   - Added employee_id parameter
   - Enhanced GeofenceStatus component for multiple geofences
   - Fixed field names (require_for_clock_in vs enforce_clock_in)

2. **API Proxy Route**:
   - Created `/api/hr/geofences/check_location/route.js`
   - Forwards requests with proper session authentication

## 5. Complete Workflow Test Results

### What's Working ✅
1. **Geofence Creation**: Saves to database with all settings
2. **Employee Assignment**: Persists in EmployeeGeofence table
3. **Location Validation**: Correctly calculates distances and permissions
4. **Clock-In Enforcement**: Respects geofence rules and overrides
5. **Multi-Geofence Support**: Handles employees assigned to multiple locations
6. **Session Integration**: Properly identifies employee from session

### Test Script
Created `/backend/pyfactor/scripts/test_geofence_workflow.py` to verify:
- Database persistence
- Distance calculations
- Permission logic
- API responses

## 6. Security & Multi-Tenancy

- All queries filtered by `business_id` for tenant isolation
- Row-Level Security (RLS) enforced at database level
- Session-based authentication required
- Location data encrypted and auto-deleted after 90 days

## Conclusion

The geofencing system is fully functional and ready for production use. Employee assignments are properly persisted, and the PWA mobile interface correctly validates employee locations against their assigned geofences before allowing clock-in/out actions.
