# Production-Ready Row Level Security (RLS) Fix

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a production-ready Row Level Security (RLS) solution
that ensures proper tenant isolation in multi-tenant applications. It addresses common RLS issues
and provides a robust solution that works with AWS RDS in production environments.

## Implemented Solution

The solution implements the following improvements:

1. **Session-based tenant context** - Uses PostgreSQL session variables rather than database-level
   parameters to avoid permission issues
   
2. **Robust RLS policies** - Creates standardized, fault-tolerant RLS policies for all tenant tables

3. **Improved error handling** - Gracefully handles edge cases and error conditions without breaking
   application functionality

4. **Diagnostics and testing** - Includes comprehensive testing and diagnostic tools to validate
   RLS effectiveness

## Technical Implementation

### Core RLS Functions

The solution implements these key functions at the database level:

1. `get_current_tenant_id()` - Gets the current tenant ID from session variables
2. `set_tenant_context(tenant_id)` - Sets the tenant context for the current session
3. `clear_tenant_context()` - Clears the tenant context, allowing access to all tenant data

### RLS Policy Structure

Each tenant-aware table receives a standardized policy that:

```sql
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON table_name
AS RESTRICTIVE
USING (
    (tenant_id::TEXT = get_current_tenant_id() AND get_current_tenant_id() != 'unset')
    OR get_current_tenant_id() = 'unset'
);
```

This policy ensures:
- Rows are only visible when tenant_id matches current context
- Special "unset" context allows viewing all rows (for admin functions)
- Handles NULL and empty tenant IDs properly

### Middleware Integration

The application uses the `RowLevelSecurityMiddleware` to:
1. Set tenant context from request information (headers, session, user)
2. Clear context for non-tenant operations
3. Restore previous context after request processing

## Testing and Verification

The solution includes several verification mechanisms:

1. **Test table** - Creates and verifies RLS on a test table with sample data
2. **Table-specific tests** - Function to test RLS for any specific table
3. **Status view** - View showing RLS status across all tenant tables

You can use the following to test RLS for a specific table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM test_rls_for_table('table_name');
```

## AWS RDS Compatibility

This solution is specifically designed to work with AWS RDS by:

1. Not requiring superuser privileges
2. Using session-level parameters instead of database-level settings
3. Working with connection pooling
4. Handling RDS-specific connection behaviors

## Cognito Integration

The tenant context is passed from AWS Cognito user attributes to application sessions. The `tenant_id` 
attribute in Cognito is essential for this implementation.

## Security Considerations

1. **Strict enforcement** - RLS policies use the RESTRICTIVE modifier to ensure they cannot be bypassed
2. **No superuser bypass** - Even if a user connects with elevated privileges, RLS remains enforced
3. **Explicit admin access** - Admin access requires explicit setting of "unset" context, not implicit bypass

## Troubleshooting

If tenant isolation issues occur:

1. Check if RLS middleware is active and setting proper tenant context
2. Verify table has `tenant_id` column and RLS enabled: `SELECT * FROM rls_status WHERE table_name = 'your_table';`
3. Test specific table: `SELECT * FROM test_rls_for_table('your_table');`
4. Try running the fix script again: `python fix_rls_production.py`

## Maintenance

For ongoing maintenance:

1. Run the RLS check periodically, especially after schema migrations
2. Ensure new tables with tenant data receive proper RLS policies
3. Monitor for any unexpected RLS policy changes

## Best Practices

1. Use the tenant context management functions rather than directly setting session variables
2. Clear tenant context after admin operations
3. Test RLS behavior with each release
4. Use the `rls_status` view to monitor policy coverage
