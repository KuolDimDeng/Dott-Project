# EB Docker Static Files Configuration Fix

## Issue
The deployment was failing with:
```
Invalid option specification (Namespace: 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles', OptionName: '/static'): Unknown configuration setting.
```

## Root Cause
The `aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles` namespace is not valid for Docker deployments. This configuration is only valid for non-Docker platforms.

## Solution
1. Removed all static files proxy configuration from:
   - Environment options JSON files
   - .ebextensions configuration files

2. Created minimal Docker-compatible configuration with only:
   - Environment variables
   - Port configuration
   - Health reporting settings

## Static Files in Docker
For Docker deployments, static files should be handled by:
1. **Django Whitenoise** - Serve static files directly from Django
2. **Dockerfile COPY** - Copy static files into the container
3. **CDN/S3** - Serve static files from external sources

## Deployment Command
```bash
./deploy_fixed_docker.sh
```

## Verification
After deployment, verify:
1. No static files configuration errors in EB logs
2. Application serves static files correctly
3. Health checks pass
