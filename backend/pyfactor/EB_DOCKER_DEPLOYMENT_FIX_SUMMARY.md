# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Docker Deployment Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-05-29
## Script: Version0091_fix_eb_docker_deployment_config.sh

### Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. Invalid Static Files Configuration
**Error**: `Invalid option specification (Namespace: 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles', OptionName: '/static'): Unknown configuration setting.`

**Root Cause**: The Docker platform on Elastic Beanstalk doesn't support the `staticfiles` configuration namespace that's used in other platforms.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed the invalid static files configuration from `.ebextensions/01_environment.config`
- Created custom nginx configuration in `.platform/nginx/conf.d/custom.conf` to handle static files
- Static files are now served directly by nginx from `/app/staticfiles/`

#### 2. Nginx Configuration Warnings
**Error**: `could not build optimal types_hash, you should increase either types_hash_max_size: 1024 or types_hash_bucket_size: 64`

**Fix Applied**:
```nginx
types_hash_max_size 2048;
types_hash_bucket_size 128;
```

#### 3. Docker Container Startup Failures
**Errors**: 
- Exit code 1, 3, 137 (SIGKILL)
- Connection refused to upstream

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added proper health check endpoint configuration
- Implemented graceful shutdown handling
- Added non-root user for security
- Included health check in Dockerfile
- Proper signal handling in gunicorn command

#### 4. Client Body Size Limitation
**Error**: `client intended to send too large body: 10485761 bytes`

**Fix Applied**:
```nginx
client_max_body_size 50M;
```

#### 5. PostgreSQL Client Installation
**Error**: Failed PostgreSQL installation in prebuild hooks

**Fix Applied**:
- Moved PostgreSQL client installation to Dockerfile
- Simplified installation process
- Removed problematic prebuild hooks

### New File Structure

├── .platform/
│   ├── nginx/
│   │   └── conf.d/

└── deploy_to_eb.sh (new - deployment script)
```

### Key Configuration Changes

#### 1. Environment Configuration (.ebextensions/01_environment.config)
```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pyfactor.settings_eb
    PYTHONPATH: /app
    PORT: 8000
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:process:default:
    Port: 8000
    Protocol: HTTP
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system:
    SystemType: enhanced
    EnhancedHealthAuthEnabled: true
```

#### 2. Nginx Configuration (.platform/nginx/conf.d/custom.conf)
- Proper upstream configuration to Django app
- Static and media file handling
- Health check endpoint with fast timeouts
- WebSocket support
- Large file upload support (50MB)

#### 3. Dockerfile Improvements
- Health check implementation
- Non-root user for security
- Proper directory permissions
- Static file collection during build
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x backend/pyfactor/scripts/Version0091_fix_eb_docker_deployment_config.sh
   ```

2. **Run the fix script**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/Version0091_fix_eb_docker_deployment_config.sh
   ```

3. **Review the changes**:
   - Check `.ebextensions/01_environment.config`
   - Review `.platform/nginx/conf.d/custom.conf`
   - Verify Dockerfile updates

4. **Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/pyfactor
   ./deploy_to_eb.sh
   ```

### Health Check Endpoint

The deployment now includes a proper health check endpoint at `/health/`. This endpoint:
- Returns HTTP 200 for healthy status
- Has fast timeouts (5s) to quickly detect issues
- Is checked every 30 seconds by the Docker health check

### Monitoring Deployment

After deployment, monitor the status:
```bash
eb status
eb logs
```

### Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, rollback to previous version:
```bash
eb deploy --version=<previous-version-label>
```

### Next Steps

1. Ensure your AWS credentials are configured
2. Verify environment variables in Elastic Beanstalk console
3. Check that your RDS instance is accessible
4. Monitor application logs after deployment

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **If deployment still fails**: Check eb-engine.log for specific errors
2. **If static files aren't served**: Verify staticfiles directory exists and has proper permissions
3. **If health checks fail**: Ensure the Django health endpoint is properly configured
4. **If database connection fails**: Verify RDS security group allows connection from EB instances

### Support

For additional support:
- Check AWS Elastic Beanstalk logs: `eb logs`
- Review Docker logs: `docker logs <container-id>`
- Monitor nginx error logs in the EB console
