# Comprehensive Docker EB Deployment Fix Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive fix implemented for AWS Elastic Beanstalk Docker deployment issues with the PyFactor backend. The fix addresses multiple issues that were preventing successful deployment.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Port Mismatch
- **Problem**: The Dockerfile configures the application to run on port 8080, but Dockerrun.aws.json specified port 8000
- **Fix**: Updated Dockerrun.aws.json to use port 8080 for both ContainerPort and HostPort

### 2. Package Size
- **Problem**: Full deployment packages exceed the 500MB AWS Elastic Beanstalk limit
- **Fix**: Created a minimal package containing only essential files needed for deployment

### 3. Configuration Parameters
- **Problem**: Some .ebextensions configuration files contained WSGI parameters not applicable to Docker deployments
- **Fix**: Removed incompatible parameters (WSGIPath, NumProcesses, NumThreads)

### 4. Python Configuration
- **Problem**: Docker container setup needs proper Python and dependency configuration
- **Fix**: Ensured proper Docker configuration for Python environment

## Deployment Package

A new minimal deployment package has been created:
- **Package Name**: `minimal-eb-package-2025-05-18132724.zip`
- **Created On**: 2025-05-18
- **Size**: Approx. 6-8MB (well under the 500MB limit)

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: AWS Management Console Deployment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk service
3. Create a new application or use an existing one
4. Create a new environment:
   - Select "Web server environment"
   - Platform: Docker
   - Application code: Upload your code
   - Upload the `minimal-eb-package-2025-05-18132724.zip` file
5. Configure environment settings:
   - Environment type: Load balanced
   - Instance type: t3.small (recommended)
   - Health check path: /health/
6. Configure environment variables (add all required environment variables)
7. Submit and wait for environment creation to complete

### Option 2: AWS CLI Deployment

1. Configure your AWS CLI credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. Create a new application version:
   ```bash
   aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version \
     --application-name "PyFactor" \
     --version-label "docker-eb-2025-05-18132724" \
     --source-bundle S3Bucket="your-bucket-name",S3Key="minimal-eb-package-2025-05-18132724.zip"
   ```

3. Deploy the new application version:
   ```bash
   aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment \
     --environment-name "PyFactor-prod" \
     --version-label "docker-eb-2025-05-18132724"
   ```

## Verifying Deployment

After deployment completes:

1. Check the environment health in the EB Console
2. Verify application functionality by accessing the application URL
3. Check the logs for any errors:
   ```bash
   aws elasticbeanstalk retrieve-environment-info --environment-name PyFactor-prod --info-type tail
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after deployment:

1. Check the Elastic Beanstalk environment logs
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure the RDS database is accessible from the EB environment
4. Check security groups and VPC configuration
5. Inspect container logs through the EB console or CLI
