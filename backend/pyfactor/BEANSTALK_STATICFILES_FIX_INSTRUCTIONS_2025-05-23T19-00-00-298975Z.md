# Elastic Beanstalk Static Files Fix - Deployment Instructions

## Issue Fixed
- **Error**: Invalid option specification (Namespace: 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles', OptionName: '/static'): Unknown configuration setting
- **Cause**: Static files configuration not compatible with Docker platform
- **Solution**: Removed static files configuration, use Docker-compatible settings

## Files Modified
- `.ebextensions/01_environment.config` - Clean configuration without static files
- `Dockerrun.aws.json` - Proper Docker configuration
- Backup created: `/Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor/configuration_backups/staticfiles_fix_2025-05-23T19-00-00-298975Z`

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: EB CLI (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor

# Initialize if needed
eb init --platform docker --region us-east-1

# Deploy with forced configuration update
eb deploy --staged --timeout 20

# Monitor deployment
eb health
eb logs
```

### Option 2: AWS Console
1. **Clear Saved Configurations**:
   - Go to AWS Console → Elastic Beanstalk → Applications → DottApps
   - Click "Saved configurations"
   - Delete any existing saved configurations that might contain static files settings

2. **Upload New Version**:
   - Create new application version with fixed configuration
   - Deploy to environment

3. **Force Configuration Reset**:
   - Go to Configuration → Software
   - Verify no static files settings are present
   - Save configuration

### Option 3: Complete Environment Recreate (If needed)
```bash
# Only if above steps don't work
eb terminate DottApps-env
eb create DottApps-env --platform docker --instance-type t3.small --single-instance
```

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check deployment status
eb status

# Check health
eb health

# View logs
eb logs

# Test endpoint
curl -k https://dottapps-env.eba-3m4eq7bw.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/health/
```

## Key Changes Made

### Before (Problematic)
- Static files configuration for non-Docker platform
- Invalid proxy settings
- Cached configurations with deprecated settings

### After (Fixed)
- Clean Docker-compatible configuration
- Proper port mapping (8080 → 80)
- No static files configuration (handled by Docker)
- Enhanced health reporting enabled
- CloudWatch logging configured

## Expected Results
- ✅ Deployment should complete successfully
- ✅ Health should change from "Severe" to "Ok"
- ✅ Backend API should be accessible
- ✅ No more static files configuration errors

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment
1. Test backend connectivity: `curl -k https://dottapps-env.eba-3m4eq7bw.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/health/`
2. Re-enable frontend-backend connectivity in Next.js
3. Test full application flow

## Troubleshooting
If deployment still fails:
1. Check Platform version compatibility
2. Verify Docker image builds locally
3. Check security groups and VPC settings
4. Consider platform update if using older version
