# Docker Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Errors Fixed

## Overview
This document outlines the key errors encountered during the Docker-based deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk and the solutions implemented to fix them.

## Error 1: Missing `setuptools` in Docker Image
### Problem
```
BackendUnavailable: Cannot import 'setuptools.build_meta'
```

The Docker container failed to build because setuptools was not installed before attempting to install Python packages.

### Solution
Updated the Dockerfile to explicitly install setuptools before any other packages:

```dockerfile
# Install setuptools explicitly before any other packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

## Error 2: Conflict Between Configuration Files
### Problem
```
Detected both docker-compose.yml and Dockerrun.aws.json V1 file in your source bundle. 
We only use Authentication Key within your Dockerrun.aws.json file.
```

Elastic Beanstalk was confused by having both `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerrun.aws.json` in the deployment package.

### Solution
1. Removed the `docker-compose.yml` file from the deployment package
2. Created a properly formatted `Dockerrun.aws.json` file with the appropriate configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": "1",
     "Image": {
       "Name": "pyfactor-backend",
       "Update": "true"
     },
     "Ports": [
       {
         "ContainerPort": "8000",
         "HostPort": "8000"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Error 3: Health Check Endpoint
### Problem
Elastic Beanstalk requires a health check endpoint to determine if the application is running properly.

### Solution
Leveraged the existing health check implementation at `/health/` which:
- Returns a 200 OK response when the application is healthy
- Checks the database connection status
- Returns appropriate JSON status information

## Error 4: Environment Configuration
### Problem
Incorrect environment configuration caused the application to fail during startup.

### Solution
Created a `docker-options.json` file with proper environment settings:
- Configured proper environment variables
- Set up appropriate instance settings
- Configured the health check path to `/health/`

## Implementation
The fixes were implemented in several key files:

1. `Dockerfile.fixed` - Updated with proper setuptools installation
2. `Dockerrun.aws.json.fixed` - Properly formatted for Elastic Beanstalk
3. `create_docker_fixed_package.sh` - Creates the deployment package with proper configuration
4. `deploy_docker_eb.sh` - Handles the full deployment process

## Deployment Process
The fixed deployment process now follows these steps:

1. Create a deployment package with the fixed configurations
2. Upload the package to S3
3. Create a new application version in Elastic Beanstalk
4. Create or update the environment 
5. Monitor the deployment progress

## Lessons Learned
1. Docker deployments to Elastic Beanstalk require specific formatting of Docker configuration files
2. Python package installation in Docker requires explicit installation of setuptools
3. Health checks are crucial for proper Elastic Beanstalk monitoring
4. Including both docker-compose.yml and Dockerrun.aws.json causes conflicts
