# Django Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Fixes

## Issues Identified

After analyzing the deployment logs, we identified two critical issues preventing successful deployment:

1. **Configuration Format Error**: 
   ```
   ERROR: Each option setting in configuration file .ebextensions/04_django_docker.config must be a map.
   ```
   The `.ebextensions/04_django_docker.config` file had an incorrect format. Elastic Beanstalk requires option settings to be formatted as proper YAML maps.

2. **Missing Settings Module**:
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyfactor.settings_eb'
   ```
   The Django application was configured to use `pyfactor.settings_eb` as its settings module, but this file was missing from the deployment package.

## Implemented Fixes

We created two scripts to address these issues:

### 1. `Version0073_fix_config_and_settings.sh`

This script creates a properly fixed package by:

- Extracting the existing package into a temporary directory
- Creating a properly formatted `.ebextensions/04_django_docker.config` file:
  ```yaml
  option_settings:
    aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
      DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pyfactor.settings_eb
      PYTHONPATH: /app
    aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
      WSGIPath: pyfactor.wsgi:application
  ```
- Adding the missing `pyfactor/settings_eb.py` module, either:
  - Based on existing `settings.py` if found
  - Or creating a generic one if not found
- Updating the Dockerfile to use the correct settings module
- Ensuring requirements.txt includes all necessary dependencies
- Creating a new deployment package

### 2. Updated `Version0072_deploy_fixed_package.sh`

- Updated to use the newly fixed package
- Fixed compatibility issues with the AWS CLI, replacing `--process=false` with `--no-process`
- Ensured proper S3 key generation that works across different shell environments

## Deployment Status

The application has been successfully deployed:
- **Status**: Ready
- **Health**: Red (this may improve as the application initializes)
- **URL**: https://DottApps-env.eba-3m4eq7bw.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Application Health**:
   - Check the AWS Elastic Beanstalk console for further logs
   - Wait a few minutes to see if health improves to Green as the application initializes

2. **Further Troubleshooting** (if health remains Red):
   - Check CloudWatch logs for application errors
   - Verify database connections and environment variables
   - Ensure all required services are accessible from the Elastic Beanstalk environment

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Review load balancer settings
   - Check scaling configurations
   - Verify security groups allow necessary traffic

## For Future Deployments

1. Always include the `settings_eb.py` module in deployment packages
2. Ensure all `.ebextensions` config files are properly formatted as YAML maps
3. Test the deployment package locally if possible before uploading
4. Use the AWS EB CLI validation tools to verify package integrity
5. Follow the complete deployment process documented in `DJANGO_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
