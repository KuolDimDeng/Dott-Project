# Fixed Docker Deployment for AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Fixes Applied

This deployment has been fixed to address the following issues:

1. **setuptools.build_meta Error**: 
   - Updated Python version from 3.12 to 3.10 for better compatibility
   - Added explicit setuptools installation before requirements
   - Fixed setuptools version in requirements-eb.txt

2. **Configuration Conflicts**:
   - Added .ebignore to exclude docker-compose.yml during deployment
   - Ensured Dockerrun.aws.json is properly configured

3. **Proxy Configuration**:
   - Added .ebextensions configuration for proper Nginx proxy settings

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare the deployment package**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   zip -r ../pyfactor-docker-deployment.zip . -x "*.git*" "*.DS_Store" "*.pyc" "__pycache__/*"
   ```

2. **Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk**:
   - Navigate to AWS Elastic Beanstalk console
   - Select your environment
   - Upload the generated zip file
   - Deploy the application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after deployment:

1. Check the Elastic Beanstalk logs
2. Verify the environment variables are set correctly
3. Check for any errors in the docker container build process

## Port Configuration

The application is configured to run on port 8080 internally, which is then mapped to port 80 externally by the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
