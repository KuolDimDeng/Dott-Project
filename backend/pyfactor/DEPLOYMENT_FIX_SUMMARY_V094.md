# Deployment Fix Summary - Version 0094

## Problem Fixed
The Docker container was crashing with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'
```

## Solution Applied
Added `python-dotenv==1.0.1` to requirements.txt alongside the existing `python-decouple==3.8`.

The issue was that `settings.py` imports from `dotenv` directly:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

While `python-decouple` is a different package that doesn't provide the `dotenv` module, `python-dotenv` is the actual package that provides it.

## Deployment Package Created
- File: `eb-deployment.zip`
- Size: 276MB (under the 512MB limit)
- Ready for deployment

## Next Steps
1. Upload `eb-deployment.zip` to AWS Elastic Beanstalk through the AWS Console:
   - Go to Elastic Beanstalk console
   - Select your application
   - Click "Upload and Deploy"
   - Choose the `eb-deployment.zip` file
   - Deploy

2. Alternative: If you have EB CLI installed elsewhere:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   eb deploy
   ```

## Requirements.txt Changes
Added:
```
python-dotenv==1.0.1
```

This should resolve the ModuleNotFoundError and allow the Docker container to start successfully.
