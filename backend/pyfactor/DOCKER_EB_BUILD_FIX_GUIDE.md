# Docker EB Build Fix Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the fix for Docker build issues in AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment with the PyFactor backend. The deployment was failing with "Failed to build the Docker image" errors.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing Files in Minimal Package
- **Problem**: The minimal package was too minimal, missing files needed for the Docker build process
- **Fix**: Created a more comprehensive package with additional essential files

### 2. Dockerfile Compatibility
- **Problem**: The Dockerfile CMD instruction may have been referencing missing files
- **Fix**: Ensured Dockerfile uses the application.py entry point

## Deployment Package

A new enhanced deployment package has been created:
- **Package Name**: `enhanced-eb-package-2025-05-18130247.zip`
- **Created On**: 2025-05-18
- **Size**: Larger than the minimal package but still well under the 500MB limit

## Deployment Instructions

### Using AWS CLI with Saved Configuration

The recommended way to deploy is using the `deploy_with_saved_config.sh` script:

```bash
cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor/scripts
./deploy_with_saved_config.sh
```

When prompted for the package, specify: `enhanced-eb-package-2025-05-18130247.zip`

### Manual AWS Console Deployment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk service
3. Create a new application version:
   - Application: Dott
   - Version label: docker-eb-enhanced-2025-05-18130247
   - Upload: `enhanced-eb-package-2025-05-18130247.zip`
4. Deploy to environment:
   - Environment: Dott-env-dev
   - Use saved configuration: DottConfiguration

## Verifying Deployment

After deployment completes:

1. Check the environment health in the EB Console
2. Verify application functionality by accessing the application URL
3. Check the logs for any errors

## Additional Notes

If this enhanced package still encounters build issues, you may need to:
1. Include additional app directories in the package
2. Check for specific dependency errors in the build logs
3. Ensure all referenced files in Dockerfile exist in the package
