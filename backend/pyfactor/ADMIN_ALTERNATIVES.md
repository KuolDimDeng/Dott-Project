# Django Admin Alternatives for Single Session System

Since we're using a custom session system without Django's session framework,
the standard Django admin is not compatible. Here are alternatives:

## Option 1: Custom Admin Interface (Recommended)
Create a custom admin interface that uses your session_manager:
- Build with Django REST Framework + React
- Use session_manager.authentication.SessionAuthentication
- Implement role-based access control

## Option 2: Third-Party Admin
Use admin interfaces that don't depend on Django sessions:
- Django-Jet (with modifications)
- React-Admin with DRF backend
- Custom Vue.js admin panel

## Option 3: Database Management
For emergency access:
- Use pgAdmin or similar PostgreSQL clients
- Create management commands for common tasks
- Use Django shell with custom authentication

## Option 4: Re-enable Django Admin (Not Recommended)
If you absolutely need Django admin:
1. Re-add django.contrib.sessions to INSTALLED_APPS
2. Re-add SessionMiddleware to MIDDLEWARE
3. Configure SESSION_ENGINE to use database
4. This creates a dual-session system (not recommended)

## Management Commands
Instead of admin, create management commands:
```python
# management/commands/create_superuser.py
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from custom_auth.models import User

class Command(BaseCommand):
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        # Create superuser logic
        pass
```

## Security Note
The custom session system provides better security than Django's default sessions.
Any admin interface should use the same session_manager for consistency.
