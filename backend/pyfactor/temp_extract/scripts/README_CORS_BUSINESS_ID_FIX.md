# CORS Business ID Header Fix

## Issue Description

The application was encountering CORS errors when making requests to the HR API endpoints. Specifically, the error was:

```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://127.0.0.1:8000/api/hr/employees.
(Reason: header 'x-business-id' is not allowed according to header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' from CORS preflight response).
```

This error occurred because:

1. The frontend was sending `X-Business-ID` header with requests 
2. The Django CORS settings in `settings.py` correctly included all case variations of business ID headers
3. However, the `CorsMiddleware` class in `custom_auth/cors.py` did not include business ID headers in its implementation
4. The HR specific middleware included business ID headers, but since the main CORS middleware runs first, its headers took precedence

## Fix Details

Two fix scripts have been created:

1. `Version0006_fix_cors_headers_for_business_id.py` - Ensures proper configuration in Django settings
2. `Version0007_fix_cors_business_id_in_cors_middleware.py` - Updates the CorsMiddleware class 

### Key Changes

1. In Django settings (`settings.py`):
   - Confirmed all case variations of business ID headers are included in `CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS`:
     - 'x-business-id'
     - 'X-Business-ID'
     - 'X-BUSINESS-ID'
   - Added business ID headers to `CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS` list

2. In CORS middleware (`custom_auth/cors.py`):
   - Updated the `_add_cors_headers` method to include all business ID headers
   - Added all case variations to both the allow headers and expose headers lists

3. The HR middleware (`hr/middleware.py`) already had the correct configuration:
   - HR-specific endpoints already correctly handled business ID headers
   - The middleware was correctly configured to add all case variations

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the fix scripts in order:
   ```
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   python scripts/Version0006_fix_cors_headers_for_business_id.py
   python scripts/Version0007_fix_cors_business_id_in_cors_middleware.py
   ```

2. Restart the Django server:
   ```
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   python run_server.py
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix and restarting the server, the HR API requests with business ID headers should work correctly. The following headers should be present in OPTIONS responses:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: ..., x-business-id, X-Business-ID, X-BUSINESS-ID, ...
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ..., x-business-id, X-Business-ID, X-BUSINESS-ID, ...
```

## Debugging CORS Issues

If CORS issues persist:

1. Check browser console for specific CORS errors
2. Use browser Developer Tools Network tab to inspect preflight OPTIONS requests
3. Verify that the Access-Control-Allow-Headers in the response includes the needed headers
4. Check that proper CORS middleware is loaded in the correct order in settings.py
