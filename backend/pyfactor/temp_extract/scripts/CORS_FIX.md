# CORS Configuration Fix for HTTPS Backend

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to connect to the backend API server running on HTTPS at https://127.0.0.1:8000. These errors prevented the frontend from successfully making requests to the backend, resulting in network errors and application functionality failures.

## Root Causes

1. **Conflicting CORS Settings**:
   - `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True` was enabled while simultaneously having `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = False`
   - This contradiction created ambiguity in how CORS requests were handled

2. **Missing HTTPS Origins**:
   - The CORS allowed origins list did not include `https://localhost:8000` and `https://127.0.0.1:8000`
   - The application's backend was running on HTTPS but not properly configured to allow itself as an origin

3. **Incomplete CSRF Settings**:
   - CSRF trusted origins were missing the HTTPS versions of the backend URLs
   - This prevented certain requests from being properly validated

## Solution

The `fix_cors_settings.py` script modifies the Django settings to:

1. Set consistent CORS configuration:
   - Set `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = False` to enforce explicit origin checking
   - Set `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = False` to ensure consistency
   - Add all necessary origins, including HTTPS versions of the backend

2. Update CSRF settings:
   - Add HTTPS versions of backend URLs to trusted origins
   - Maintain existing security settings

3. Implement best practices:
   - Use appropriate preflight cache duration
   - Preserve security headers
   - Keep all required CORS headers

## How to Use

1. Ensure the backend server is not running
2. Run the script from the backend/pyfactor directory:
   ```
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   python scripts/fix_cors_settings.py
   ```
3. Restart the backend server:
   ```
   python run_server.py
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix and restarting the server, the frontend should be able to successfully make requests to the backend without CORS errors. You can verify this by:

1. Checking browser developer tools console for absence of CORS errors
2. Confirming that API requests from the frontend to the backend complete successfully
3. Verifying that the application functionality dependent on API calls works as expected

## Version History

- v1.0 (Current) - Initial implementation to fix CORS issues with HTTPS backend
