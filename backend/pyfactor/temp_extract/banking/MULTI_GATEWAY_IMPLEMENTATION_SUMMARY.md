# Multi-Gateway Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have enhanced the Connect to Bank feature to support multiple payment gateways per country with priority levels. This allows the system to offer users different payment gateway options based on their location, increasing the flexibility and reliability of the bank connection process.

## Changes Made

1. **Model Structure Updates**
   - Replaced the single `CountryPaymentGateway` model with three models:
     - `Country`: Stores country information (name, code)
     - `PaymentGateway`: Stores payment gateway information
     - `CountryPaymentGateway`: Maps countries to payment gateways with priority levels

2. **Utility Function Updates**
   - Enhanced `get_payment_gateway_for_country` to return all available gateways for a country
   - Added support for prioritization (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary)
   - Improved error handling and logging

3. **New Connect to Bank Implementation**
   - Updated `connect_bank_account` function to work with the new multi-gateway model
   - Added placeholder functions for each gateway integration
   - Implemented selection of gateway from request or defaulting to primary

4. **Data Population**
   - Created script to populate the models with comprehensive country-gateway mappings
   - Created CSV file with country codes, names, and multiple gateway options
   - Set up script to handle migration and data population

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated documentation to explain the new multi-gateway system
   - Added examples and usage guidelines
   - Documented the mapping logic and gateway distribution
   
6. **Gateway Prioritization Update (2025-04-28)**
   - Updated to prioritize Plaid as the primary gateway in all supported countries
   - Adjusted the order of other gateways accordingly 
   - Ensured better integration with financial institutions in regions where Plaid has strong support

## Gateway Support

The system now supports the following payment gateways:

- Plaid (primary in US, Canada, UK, and EU countries)
- Wise (formerly TransferWise)
- Stripe
- PayPal
- DLocal
- Mercado Pago
- Razorpay
- iyzico
- M-Pesa

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Connect to Bank" in the Banking menu
2. System retrieves the user's country from Cognito attributes
3. System gets available payment gateways for that country
4. User is presented with gateway options in order of priority
5. User selects a gateway and completes the connection process
6. Bank account is successfully connected
