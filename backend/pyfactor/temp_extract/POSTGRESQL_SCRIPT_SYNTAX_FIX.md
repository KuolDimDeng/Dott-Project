# PostgreSQL Script Syntax Fix

## Problem Identified

During deployment of our Docker application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the following error occurred:

```
ERROR: An error occurred during execution of command [app-deploy] - [RunAppDeployPreBuildHooks]. 
Stop running the command. Error: Command .platform/hooks/prebuild/00_install_postgresql.sh failed with error exit status 2.
Stderr:.platform/hooks/prebuild/00_install_postgresql.sh: line 47: syntax error near unexpected token `fi'
```

## Root Cause

The shell script `.platform/hooks/prebuild/00_install_postgresql.sh` contained inline comments within if statement conditions, breaking the shell syntax:

```bash
# Problematic code - comments inside the if condition:
if sudo dnf install -y libpq-devel # Replaced libpq-devel # Replaced postgresql-devel for AL2023 compatibility for AL2023 compatibility; then
    echo "Successfully installed postgresql-devel"
    return 0
fi
```

Shell scripting syntax doesn't allow inline comments within command conditionals like this. The `#` character and everything after it is treated as a comment, but in this context it breaks the if statement structure.

## Solution

The fix was to move the comments to their own lines before the if statement:

```bash
# Note: Replaced postgresql-devel with libpq-devel for AL2023 compatibility
if sudo dnf install -y libpq-devel; then
    echo "Successfully installed postgresql-devel"
    return 0
fi
```

This preserves the comments while maintaining proper shell script syntax.

## Implementation

1. Created a backup of the original script
2. Fixed the syntax errors in two places:
   - In the AL2023 installation section (around line 47)
   - In the AL2 installation section (around line 71)
3. Created a new deployment package with the fixed script
4. Updated the documentation to reference the new package

## New Deployment Package

A new fixed deployment package has been created:
`docker-eb-package-script-fixed-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.zip`

This package maintains all previous fixes while also addressing the PostgreSQL script syntax error.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the application with this fix, follow the standard deployment process but use the latest fixed package:

1. Use the AWS Management Console
2. Create a new environment or update an existing one
3. Upload the package with the fixed PostgreSQL script
4. Make sure to select 'nginx' as the proxy server
5. Follow the detailed instructions in `AWS_CONSOLE_UPLOAD_STEPS_DOCKER.md`

This fix ensures the PostgreSQL installation pre-build hook runs correctly during deployment.
