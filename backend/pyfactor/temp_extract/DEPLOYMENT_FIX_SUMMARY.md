# Deployment Fixes Summary - Docker S3 Integration Issues

## Issues Fixed

We identified and fixed two key issues with the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Docker deployment:

1. **File Name Mismatch in Dockerfile**: 
   - The Dockerfile was downloading one S3 file (`full-app-code-20250517230112.zip`) but trying to unzip a different one (`full-app-code-20250517224600.zip`).
   - This caused the Docker build to fail during the application code extraction step.

2. **S3 Access Permissions (403 Forbidden)**:
   - The EC2 instance running the Docker container did not have permissions to access the S3 bucket.
   - This resulted in a `403 Forbidden` error when trying to download the application code from S3.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed S3 File Name Mismatch

We created a script (`Version0037_fix_s3_file_mismatch.js`) that updates the `create_minimal_package.sh` script to:
- Use the same file name for both downloading and unzipping operations
- Use the latest S3 file name (`full-app-code-20250517230538.zip`)
- Add a notice that the Docker container will use the EC2 instance profile for AWS credentials

### 2. Added IAM Role Configuration for S3 Access

We created a new `.ebextensions` configuration file (`06_s3_permissions.config`) that:
- Creates an IAM policy granting access to the S3 bucket
- Attaches the policy to the EC2 instance role
- Configures AWS CloudFormation authentication for S3
- Sets up the proper IAM instance profile for the EC2 instances

## How to Deploy

To deploy the application with these fixes:

1. **Recreate the minimal package**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/create_minimal_package.sh
   ```

2. **Run the complete deployment process**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/complete_deployment.sh
   ```

The deployment process will:
1. Create a minimal Docker deployment package with the correct file references
2. Create/update the full application code package
3. Upload both packages to S3
4. Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk with IAM permissions properly configured

## Technical Details

### IAM Permissions Added

The EC2 instance running your Docker container now has these S3 permissions:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::dott-app-deployments-dockerebmanual001",
        "arn:aws:s3:::dott-app-deployments-dockerebmanual001/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dockerfile Changes

The Dockerfile in the minimal package now includes:
- Clear indication that it's using EC2 instance profile for AWS credentials
- Consistent S3 file name references
- Proper error handling

## Verification

After deployment, you can verify the fix worked by:

1. Checking the Elastic Beanstalk logs in the AWS Console
2. Accessing the application URL
3. Confirming that the deployment status is "Successful" in the EB Console

If you encounter any issues, you can check the EC2 instance logs:
```bash
eb ssh
sudo less /var/log/eb-docker/containers/eb-current-app/log/eb-docker.log
