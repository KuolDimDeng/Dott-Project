# Scaling Strategy for Multi-Tenant Architecture

This document outlines our approach to scaling our schema-based multi-tenant application from 0 to 10,000+ users.

## Current Architecture

Our application uses a schema-based multi-tenant approach, where each tenant's data is isolated in its own PostgreSQL schema. This provides strong data isolation and security while allowing us to efficiently use database resources.

## Scaling Components Implemented

### 1. Tenant Metadata Service (`custom_auth/tenant_metadata.py`)

The tenant metadata service provides:

- Central registry for tenant information
- Efficient tenant lookup with caching
- Schema name generation and tracking
- Thread-local storage for tenant context

```python
# Example usage
from custom_auth.tenant_metadata import TenantMetadataService

# Get tenant information
tenant_info = TenantMetadataService.get_tenant_info(tenant_id)

# Set current tenant context
TenantMetadataService.set_current_tenant(tenant_id)

# Get schema name for tenant
schema_name = TenantMetadataService.get_schema_name(tenant_id)
```

### 2. Connection Pool Manager (`custom_auth/connection_pool.py`)

The connection pool manager provides:

- Efficient database connection pooling
- Connection metrics and monitoring
- Automatic connection cleanup
- Tenant-aware connection handling

```python
# Example usage
from custom_auth.connection_pool import ConnectionPoolManager

# Get connection for current tenant
conn = ConnectionPoolManager.get_connection()

# Release connection
ConnectionPoolManager.release_connection()

# Get connection statistics
stats = ConnectionPoolManager.get_connection_stats()
```

### 3. Tenant Metrics Collector (`custom_auth/tenant_metrics.py`)

The tenant metrics collector provides:

- Collection of tenant-specific usage metrics
- Identification of problematic tenants
- Monitoring of tenant resource usage
- Insights for capacity planning

```python
# Example usage
from custom_auth.tenant_metrics import TenantMetricsCollector

# Record a database query
TenantMetricsCollector.record_query(
    tenant_id=tenant_id,
    query_type='read',
    execution_time=0.1,
    row_count=100
)

# Get metrics for a tenant
metrics = TenantMetricsCollector.get_tenant_metrics(tenant_id)

# Identify problematic tenants
problematic_tenants = TenantMetricsCollector.identify_problematic_tenants()
```

## Scaling Strategy

### Phase 1: 0-1,000 Users (Current)

Our current architecture is well-suited for the initial phase of growth:

1. **Single Database Instance**
   - All tenants share a single PostgreSQL instance
   - Each tenant has its own schema for data isolation
   - Connection pooling optimizes resource usage

2. **Efficient Connection Management**
   - Connection pooling prevents connection exhaustion
   - Connection metrics help identify issues
   - Automatic connection cleanup prevents leaks

3. **Tenant Metrics Collection**
   - Monitor tenant usage patterns
   - Identify problematic tenants
   - Collect data for capacity planning

### Phase 2: 1,000-10,000 Users

As we grow to 10,000 users, we'll implement:

1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Upgrade to larger RDS instances
   - Optimize database configuration
   - Consider migrating to Amazon Aurora for better performance

2. **Read Replicas**
   - Add read replicas for reporting and analytics
   - Offload read-heavy operations
   - Implement read/write splitting

3. **Enhanced Caching**
   - Implement more aggressive caching
   - Use Redis for shared caching
   - Consider adding a CDN for static assets

### Phase 3: 10,000+ Users (Future)

For future growth beyond 10,000 users, we've designed our architecture to support:

1. **Database Sharding**
   - Implement tenant sharding across multiple databases
   - Use consistent hashing for tenant assignment
   - Migrate tenants between shards as needed

2. **Regional Distribution**
   - Deploy database clusters in multiple regions
   - Assign tenants to the closest region
   - Implement cross-region replication

3. **Advanced Resource Governance**
   - Implement tenant-specific resource quotas
   - Add rate limiting based on tenant tier
   - Isolate problematic tenants

## Monitoring and Operations

To effectively operate this architecture:

1. **Tenant-Dimension Metrics**
   - Monitor resource usage by tenant
   - Track connection usage and query patterns
   - Identify problematic tenants

2. **Proactive Maintenance**
   - Regularly analyze tenant usage patterns
   - Optimize database configuration
   - Schedule maintenance during off-hours

3. **Tenant Migration**
   - Develop procedures for moving tenants between schemas
   - Test tenant migration processes
   - Prepare for future sharding

## Conclusion

Our approach focuses on building a solid foundation that can scale from 0 to 10,000+ users. By implementing proper tenant metadata management, connection pooling, and tenant metrics collection, we've created a system that can efficiently handle our current needs while being prepared for future growth.

The architecture is designed with "sharding seams" that will allow us to implement more advanced scaling strategies as needed, without requiring a complete rewrite of the application.
