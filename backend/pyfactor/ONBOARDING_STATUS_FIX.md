# Onboarding Status Fix Documentation

## Issue
Users who completed onboarding were being redirected back to onboarding after clearing browser cache. The backend was returning `needs_onboarding: true` even after successful onboarding completion.

## Root Causes

1. **Backend Data Model Issue**: The `/api/users/me/` endpoint checks OnboardingProgress model fields, not CustomUser fields
2. **Data Integrity Issues**:
   - Boolean fields stored as strings ("true"/"false" instead of True/False)
   - Missing or incorrect tenant_id in OnboardingProgress records
   - Type mismatches in owner_id field (string vs integer)
3. **Authentication Issue**: Frontend not sending session tokens in correct format to backend
4. **Middleware Issue**: Enhanced RLS middleware only accepting Auth0 tokens, not session tokens

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Backend Fix Script
Created `scripts/fix_onboarding_completion_status.py` that properly updates OnboardingProgress model:
- Sets `onboarding_status = 'complete'`
- Sets `setup_completed = True`
- Fixes boolean field corruption
- Ensures tenant_id is set correctly
- Creates missing OnboardingProgress records

### 2. Frontend Authentication Fix
Updated `/api/onboarding/business-info/route.js`:
- Now sends session token as `Authorization: Session <token>`
- Falls back to Bearer token if no session token
- Properly validates authentication before backend calls

### 3. Middleware Enhancement
Updated `enhanced_rls_middleware.py`:
- Now accepts both Session and Auth0 authentication
- Tries Session auth first, then Auth0
- Prevents 403 errors for valid session tokens

## How to Fix Affected Users

### Option 1: Fix Individual User
```python
python manage.py shell
>>> from scripts.fix_onboarding_completion_status import fix_user_onboarding_status
>>> fix_user_onboarding_status('user@example.com')
```

### Option 2: Fix All Users with Tenants
```python
python manage.py shell
>>> from scripts.fix_onboarding_completion_status import fix_all_users_with_tenants
>>> fix_all_users_with_tenants()
```

### Option 3: Check Data Integrity
```python
python manage.py shell
>>> from scripts.fix_onboarding_completion_status import check_data_integrity
>>> check_data_integrity()
```

## Verification

After running the fix:
1. User's OnboardingProgress.onboarding_status should be 'complete'
2. User's OnboardingProgress.setup_completed should be True
3. User's active sessions are cleared (forces fresh login)
4. User can sign in and go directly to dashboard

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always update OnboardingProgress model when marking onboarding complete
2. Use proper boolean values (True/False) not strings
3. Ensure tenant_id is set in OnboardingProgress
4. Test with browser cache cleared to verify persistence
