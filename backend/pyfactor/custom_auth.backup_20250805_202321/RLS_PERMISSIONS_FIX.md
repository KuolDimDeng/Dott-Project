# Row Level Security (RLS) Permission Fix

## Problem Description

The application was encountering the following error when trying to verify RLS configuration:

```
permission denied to set parameter "app.current_tenant_id"
CONTEXT: SQL statement "ALTER DATABASE dott_main SET app.current_tenant_id = 'unset'"
```

This error occurred because:

1. The application was trying to use `ALTER DATABASE` to set a global database parameter
2. The database user (`dott_admin`) did not have sufficient privileges to change database-level settings
3. The system was repeatedly trying this operation during startup/initialization

## Solution

We've implemented a production-ready fix that avoids the need for superuser privileges by:

1. Using session-level parameters instead of database-level parameters
2. Creating PostgreSQL functions that properly handle tenant context with fallbacks
3. Using `set_config()` which is available to regular users instead of `ALTER DATABASE`

### Key Changes

1. Created a new `rls_fix.py` module with a safer implementation approach
2. Updated `rls_middleware.py` to use this new approach
3. Modified `verify_rls_configuration()` in `rls.py` to avoid using `ALTER DATABASE`
4. Made tenant context functions more resilient to handle various error conditions

### Technical Implementation

The fix uses PostgreSQL's `set_config()` function to set parameters at the session level only:

```sql
-- Set parameters at session level (doesn't require superuser)
PERFORM set_config('app.current_tenant_id', tenant, FALSE);
```

This approach:
- Works in production without needing database-level configuration
- Ensures proper tenant isolation on a per-connection basis
- Is more secure as it doesn't require elevated database privileges

## How to Verify the Fix

When the application starts, it now:

1. Creates the necessary tenant context functions using `set_config()` 
2. Tests that the RLS policies work correctly with test data
3. Logs success or detailed diagnostic information if tests fail

The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing code while removing the dependency on superuser privileges.

## Production Readiness

This implementation meets all the requirements for a production-ready system:

1. **Security**: No need for elevated database privileges
2. **Scalability**: Works with any number of concurrent database connections
3. **Reliability**: Includes proper error handling and fallbacks
4. **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
5. **Maintainability**: Fully documented and easy to understand

## Additional Considerations

For complete tenant isolation, ensure:

1. All tenant-specific tables have a `tenant_id` column
2. RLS policies are enabled on all these tables
3. Proper indexing is in place for `tenant_id` columns

## Troubleshooting

If RLS issues persist:

1. Check database user permissions (should have table creation/modification rights)
2. Verify that all tables with `tenant_id` columns have RLS policies applied
3. Ensure all database connections properly set the tenant context
