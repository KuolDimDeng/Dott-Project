# Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Fix Summary

**Date:** May 15, 2025  
**Author:** DevOps Team  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed to fix Elastic Beanstalk deployment issues with our Django application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Python 3.9/3.11 on Amazon Linux 2023.

## Issue Diagnosis

After multiple deployment attempts and reviewing log files, we identified several key issues:

1. **Requirements File Formatting Issues**:
   - The requirements-eb.txt file had a text line at the top that wasn't a proper comment
   - This caused pip to fail when parsing the file with "Invalid requirement" errors

2. **Package Dependency Conflicts**:
   - Conflicts between urllib3, boto3, botocore, and s3transfer versions
   - Error message: "ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#fixing-conflicting-dependencies"

3. **Path and Script Issues**:
   - Environment variable and path inconsistencies in hook scripts
   - Incorrect error handling in prebuild, predeploy, and postdeploy scripts

## Solutions Implemented

We created a series of scripts to methodically address each issue:

### 1. Version0001_fix_eb_deployment.py

**Purpose**: Fix initial deployment issues including path inconsistencies and package metadata.

- Fixed paths in hook scripts to use `/var/app/staging/venv` (prebuild) and `/var/app/venv` (predeploy/postdeploy)
- Downgraded textract from unstable to 1.6.4
- Corrected extract-msg dependency syntax
- Added pip version constraint

### 2. Version0002_fix_dependencies_conflict.py 

**Purpose**: Resolve dependency conflicts between urllib3 and other packages.

- Downgraded urllib3 from 2.2.1 to 1.26.16
- Updated boto3 (1.28.62) and botocore (1.31.62) versions
- Enhanced prebuild script with fallback mechanism
- Added explicit installation of critical packages

### 3. Version0003_fix_requirements_format.py

**Purpose**: Fix the requirements-eb.txt formatting causing "Invalid requirement" errors.

- Fixed the non-commented line at the top of the file
- Moved all comments to the top of the file
- Removed duplicate comments
- Added proper header with version information

### 4. Version0004_fix_dependencies_conflicts_v2.py

**Purpose**: Resolve remaining s3transfer conflicts with boto packages.

- Downgraded s3transfer from 0.10.1 to 0.6.2
- Updated boto3 to 1.26.164 and botocore to 1.29.164 for better compatibility
- Enhanced prebuild script with a two-phase installation approach:
  1. Install core dependencies first
  2. Try regular install, with fallback to --no-deps + critical packages

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the application with all fixes applied:

1. **Apply all fixes sequentially** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   python scripts/Version0001_fix_eb_deployment.py
   python scripts/Version0002_fix_dependencies_conflict.py
   python scripts/Version0003_fix_requirements_format.py
   python scripts/Version0004_fix_dependencies_conflicts_v2.py
   ```

2. **Create a new environment**:
   ```bash
   eb create pyfactor-dev-env-10 -p python-3.9 -i t3.small
   ```

3. **Alternatively, use our deployment scripts**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/eb_deploy_config.sh
   # OR
   ./scripts/eb_recreate_env.sh --env-name pyfactor-dev-env-10 --python-version 3.9 --instance-type t3.small
   ```

## Verification

After deployment, verify the application is running correctly:

```bash
eb status pyfactor-dev-env-10
eb health pyfactor-dev-env-10
```

If issues persist, check the logs:

```bash
eb logs pyfactor-dev-env-10 --all
```

## Future Work

1. **Enhanced Dependency Management**: 
   - Implement a more robust dependency management system
   - Consider using Poetry or Pipenv for deterministic builds

2. **Automated Testing**: 
   - Create a test suite for EB deployments
   - Implement pre-deployment validation checks

3. **Path Standardization**:
   - Standardize paths across all hook scripts
   - Create a shared configuration for environment variables

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Add CloudWatch alarms for application health
   - Set up notifications for deployment failures
