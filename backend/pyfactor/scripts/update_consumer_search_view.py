SOLUTION: Update Consumer Search to Include Placeholder Businesses
==================================================================

Since placeholder businesses don't have user accounts (they're not registered),
we can't migrate them to marketplace_business_listing table which requires a business_id.

Instead, we should:

1. Update the ConsumerSearchViewSet to return BOTH:
   - Real businesses from marketplace_business_listing
   - Placeholder businesses from placeholder_businesses

2. In the API response, mark which ones are placeholders with a flag:
   - is_placeholder: true/false
   
3. The mobile app already handles this flag to show the notification system

CURRENT SITUATION:
- 4,539 placeholder businesses exist in placeholder_businesses table
- 0 businesses in marketplace_business_listing (no registered businesses yet)
- Mobile app is ready to handle placeholder businesses

NEXT STEPS:
1. Update marketplace/views.py ConsumerSearchViewSet to query both tables
2. Combine results with proper categorization
3. Mark placeholder businesses with is_placeholder=true flag

This way, consumers can see all 4,539 businesses immediately without migration!
