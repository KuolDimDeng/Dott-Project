## Usage

### Check if a country is eligible:

from users.models import DevelopingCountry

# Check eligibility
is_eligible = DevelopingCountry.is_eligible('MZ')  # Mozambique
discount = DevelopingCountry.get_discount('MZ')  # Returns 50
```

### Management Commands:
```bash
# List all developing countries
python manage.py manage_developing_countries --list

# Show statistics
python manage.py manage_developing_countries --stats

# Group by region
python manage.py manage_developing_countries --by-region

# Group by income level
python manage.py manage_developing_countries --by-income

# Export to JSON
python manage.py manage_developing_countries --export countries.json

# Check for duplicates
python manage.py manage_developing_countries --check-duplicates
```

### Verify the migration:
```bash
python manage.py shell < scripts/verify_developing_countries.py
```

## Rationale
This expansion ensures:
1. **Fair representation**: Africa now has proper representation with 53 countries instead of just 15
2. **Global accessibility**: More businesses in developing nations can access affordable tools
3. **Income-based classification**: Uses World Bank income classifications for accuracy
4. **Comprehensive coverage**: Includes small island nations often overlooked

## Security Considerations
The discount verification system (`DiscountVerification` model) helps prevent abuse by:
- Tracking IP addresses and login patterns
- Verifying payment method origins
- Calculating risk scores
- Flagging suspicious accounts for manual review
- 30-day grace period for verification

## Future Considerations
- Regular review of country classifications as economies develop
- Potential for tiered discounts based on income levels
- Integration with payment providers for automatic verification
