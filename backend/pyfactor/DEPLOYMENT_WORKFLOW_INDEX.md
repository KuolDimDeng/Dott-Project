# Docker Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Resources Index

## Deployment Workflow

### 1. Prepare Docker Configuration
- **Fixed Dockerfile**: `Dockerfile.fixed`
  - Includes explicit setuptools installation
  - Properly configures the Django application
  - Sets up health check endpoint

- **Elastic Beanstalk Docker Configuration**: `Dockerrun.aws.json.fixed`
  - Defines container ports and mappings
  - Sets up volume mounts
  - Configures logging

### 2. Create Deployment Package
- **Package Creation Script**: `scripts/create_docker_fixed_package.sh`
  - Creates a complete deployment package
  - Applies Docker configuration fixes
  - Sets up health check endpoint
  - Removes conflicting docker-compose.yml

### 3. Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
- **Deployment Script**: `scripts/deploy_docker_eb.sh`
  - Creates deployment package with fixed configurations
  - Uploads to S3
  - Creates application version in Elastic Beanstalk
  - Creates or updates environment

### 4. Monitor and Troubleshoot
- **Log Check Script**: `scripts/check_deployment_logs.sh`
  - Retrieves logs from Elastic Beanstalk
  - Checks environment health
  - Provides debugging information
