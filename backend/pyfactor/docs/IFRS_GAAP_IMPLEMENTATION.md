# IFRS/GAAP Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented dual IFRS/GAAP accounting standards support across your application. The system now automatically selects the appropriate standard based on the user's business country and allows manual override in settings.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **Business Model Enhancement**: Added `accounting_standard` field to BusinessDetails model
- **Country-Based Defaults**: Created accounting standards mapping (GAAP for US, IFRS for 166+ countries)
- **Settings Integration**: Added accounting standard selection in Currency Preferences section
- **Inventory Valuation**: Implemented FIFO, LIFO, and Weighted Average methods with proper restrictions

### 2. Module-Specific Implementations

#### Sales Module
- **Inventory Cost Calculation**: Uses appropriate valuation method (FIFO/LIFO/Weighted Average) based on business settings
- **Revenue Recognition**: Framework for ASC 606 / IFRS 15 compliance (5-step model)
- **Journal Entries**: Automatically calculate COGS using the selected inventory method

#### Purchases Module  
- **Development Cost Capitalization**: IFRS allows capitalization when criteria met; GAAP requires expensing
- **Asset Classification**: Different treatment for R&D costs between standards
- **Purchase Accounting Service**: Created dedicated service for IFRS/GAAP compliant purchase entries

#### Payroll Module
- **Compensated Absences**: Both standards implemented with slight differences in recognition criteria
- **Vacation Accruals**: Proper liability recognition based on accounting standard
- **Tax Remittance**: Standard-compliant journal entries for payroll tax payments

### 3. Key Differences Implemented

| Feature | IFRS | US GAAP |
|---------|------|---------|
| Inventory Valuation | FIFO, Weighted Average only | FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average |
| Development Costs | Can be capitalized if criteria met | Generally expensed |
| Asset Revaluation | Allowed | Not allowed |
| Component Depreciation | Required | Permitted |
| Financial Statement Names | Statement of Financial Position | Balance Sheet |
| Compensated Absences | All must be accrued | Only if payment is probable |

### 4. Database Updates
- Created migrations for new fields
- Added inventory layer tracking for FIFO/LIFO
- Updated material models to support multiple valuation methods

### 5. API Endpoints
- `/api/users/api/business/settings/` - GET/PATCH accounting standard
- Integrated with existing business settings APIs

## Next Steps

1. **Financial Reports** (Task #56 - Pending)
   - Update balance sheet format based on standard
   - Implement different statement names
   - Add standard-specific disclosures

2. **Testing Recommendations**
   - Test inventory valuation with different methods
   - Verify LIFO restriction for IFRS businesses
   - Test development cost capitalization logic
   - Validate payroll accruals

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add more sophisticated revenue recognition rules
   - Implement lease accounting differences (IFRS 16 vs ASC 842)
   - Add financial instrument classification differences
   - Implement more detailed pension accounting

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `/backend/pyfactor/users/models.py` - Added accounting standard fields
- `/backend/pyfactor/users/accounting_standards.py` - Country mapping logic
- `/backend/pyfactor/accounting/services.py` - Central accounting service
- `/backend/pyfactor/inventory/accounting_methods.py` - FIFO/LIFO implementation
- `/backend/pyfactor/sales/services/accounting_service.py` - Sales accounting
- `/backend/pyfactor/purchases/accounting_service.py` - Purchase accounting
- `/backend/pyfactor/payroll/accounting_service.py` - Payroll accounting

### Frontend
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/Settings/components/sections/CurrencyPreferences.js` - UI for selection
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/components/FinancialManagement.js` - Landing page section
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/components/Hero.js` - Marketing message

## Usage

1. New users automatically get IFRS or GAAP based on their country
2. Users can manually change in Settings → Business → Currency & Accounting
3. LIFO inventory method only appears for GAAP users
4. All journal entries now respect the selected accounting standard

The implementation provides a solid foundation for international accounting compliance while maintaining flexibility for user preferences.
