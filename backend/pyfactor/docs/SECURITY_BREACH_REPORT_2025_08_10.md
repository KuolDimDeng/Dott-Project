# CRITICAL SECURITY BREACH REPORT
**Date**: August 10, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Multi-Tenant Data Exposure  
**Status**: FIXED

---

## Executive Summary

Multiple critical security breaches were discovered allowing users to access data from ALL tenants instead of just their own. The primary user affected was Monica Deng (jubacargovillage@outlook.com) who could see all invoices, customers, products, services, and employees from every business in the system.

---

## Breach #1: Invoice & Customer Data Exposure

### Discovery
- **User**: jubacargovillage@outlook.com (Monica Deng)
- **Issue**: Could see ALL invoices and customers from ALL tenants
- **Affected Models**: Invoice, Customer, Vendor, Product, Service

### Root Cause
1. ViewSets were using `.all()` without tenant filtering
2. No Row-Level Security (RLS) policies at database level
3. No middleware enforcement of tenant context
4. Missing `tenant_id` fields on many models

### Fix Applied
1. Created `TenantIsolatedViewSet` base class that enforces tenant filtering
2. Updated 214+ ViewSets to inherit from `TenantIsolatedViewSet`
3. Added `tenant_id` field to 116+ models
4. Implemented `EnhancedTenantMiddleware` to set tenant context globally
5. Added database-level RLS policies for critical tables

### Code Changes
```python
# Before (VULNERABLE)
class InvoiceViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Invoice.objects.all()  # Shows ALL invoices!

# After (SECURE)
class InvoiceViewSet(TenantIsolatedViewSet):
    queryset = Invoice.objects.all()  # Automatically filtered by tenant
```

---

## Breach #2: Product & Service Data Exposure via `.all_objects` Manager

### Discovery
- **Location**: `/inventory/views.py`
- **Issue**: ProductViewSet and ServiceViewSet using `Product.all_objects.all()` which bypasses ALL filtering

### Root Cause
Django's custom managers like `.all_objects` completely bypass tenant filtering, showing ALL records from ALL businesses.

### Fix Applied
1. Removed all `.all_objects` usage from production code
2. Created audit script to find any `.all_objects` usage
3. Changed to use standard `.objects` manager with explicit tenant filtering

### Code Changes
```python
# Before (CRITICAL BREACH)
class ProductViewSet(TenantIsolatedViewSet):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return Product.all_objects.all()  # BYPASSES all tenant filtering!

# After (SECURE)
class ProductViewSet(TenantIsolatedViewSet):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset()  # Properly filtered by tenant
```

### Audit Results
Found and fixed `.all_objects` usage in:
- `/inventory/views.py` - ProductViewSet
- `/inventory/views.py` - product_list function
- `/inventory/views.py` - service_list function
- `/jobs/views.py` - Customer query

## Breach #3: Employee Data Exposure via NULL business_id

### Discovery
- **User**: jubacargovillage@outlook.com
- **Issue**: Could see ALL 10 employees instead of just 1 (herself)
- **Critical Finding**: Monica's `business_id` was NULL

### Root Cause
1. Employee model doesn't inherit from `TenantAwareModel`
2. Employee API uses direct `.objects.filter(business_id=business_id)`
3. When `business_id` is NULL, filtering fails and shows all employees
4. User creation process didn't ensure `business_id` was set

### Fix Applied
1. Created fix script to set Monica's `business_id = tenant_id`
2. Updated Employee API to auto-fix users with `tenant_id` but no `business_id`
3. Added security audit logging for all employee queries
4. Created employee record for Monica with proper tenant isolation

### Code Changes
```python
# Added to hr/api_v2.py
if not business_id:
    # CRITICAL FIX: If user has tenant_id but no business_id, fix it
    if hasattr(request.user, 'tenant_id') and request.user.tenant_id:
        request.user.business_id = request.user.tenant_id
        request.user.save()
        business_id = request.user.tenant_id
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Monica saw 10 employees (ALL employees in system)
- **After**: Monica sees 1 employee (only herself)

---

## Breach #4: Dashboard Aggregations Counting ALL Records

### Discovery
- **Location**: `/crm/views.py` CustomerViewSet dashboard methods
- **Issue**: Dashboard stats counting ALL records across ALL tenants

### Root Cause
Dashboard aggregation methods were using:
```python
total_customers = Customer.objects.all().count()  # Counts ALL tenants!
```

### Fix Applied
Changed to use filtered queryset:
```python
total_customers = self.get_queryset().count()  # Only current tenant
```

---

## Security Architecture Implemented

### 1. Multi-Layer Tenant Isolation
```
Layer 1: Database RLS Policies (PostgreSQL level)
Layer 2: Django Model Managers (ORM level)  
Layer 3: ViewSet Base Class (API level)
Layer 4: Middleware Context (Request level)
Layer 5: Monitoring & Alerts (Runtime level)
```

### 2. Base Classes Created

#### TenantIsolatedViewSet
```python
class TenantIsolatedViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """Base ViewSet that enforces tenant isolation"""
    
    def get_queryset(self):
        tenant_id = self.get_tenant_id()
        if not tenant_id:
            raise PermissionDenied("No tenant context")
        
        queryset = super().get_queryset()
        
        # Force tenant filtering
        if hasattr(queryset.model, 'tenant_id'):
            return queryset.filter(tenant_id=tenant_id)
        elif hasattr(queryset.model, 'business_id'):
            return queryset.filter(business_id=tenant_id)
        
        # Log potential security issue
        logger.critical(f"Model {queryset.model} has no tenant field!")
        return queryset.none()
```

#### TenantAwareModel
```python
class TenantAwareModel(models.Model):
    """Base model with tenant_id for RLS"""
    tenant_id = models.UUIDField(
        db_index=True,
        null=True,
        help_text="Used by Row Level Security"
    )
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

### 3. Middleware Implementation
```python
class EnhancedTenantMiddleware:
    """Sets tenant context for EVERY request"""
    
    def __call__(self, request):
        if request.user.is_authenticated:
            tenant_id = request.user.business_id or request.user.tenant_id
            
            if not tenant_id:
                # Block request - no tenant context
                return JsonResponse({
                    'error': 'No tenant context',
                    'code': 'NO_TENANT_CONTEXT'
                }, status=403)
            
            # Set PostgreSQL session variable for RLS
            with connection.cursor() as cursor:
                cursor.execute(
                    "SET LOCAL app.current_tenant_id = %s",
                    [str(tenant_id)]
                )
```

## Testing & Validation

### Local Testing Results
```
Monica Deng (jubacargovillage@outlook.com):
- Business ID: 24756df1-35dc-45ed-91c8-e2f025d88ddd (was NULL)
- Employees visible: 1 (was 10)
- Products visible: 0 (was ALL)
- Invoices visible: 0 (was ALL)
- Customers visible: 0 (was ALL)
```

### Security Audit Scripts Created
1. `scripts/audit_all_objects.py` - Finds dangerous `.all_objects` usage
2. `scripts/check_monica_business.py` - Checks user tenant configuration
3. `scripts/fix_monica_business.py` - Fixes NULL business_id issues
4. `scripts/security_audit.py` - Comprehensive security check

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Security Events Logged
```python
# Critical events now logged
logger.critical(f"üö® CROSS-TENANT ACCESS ATTEMPT: User {user.email} tried to access tenant {requested_tenant}")
logger.warning(f"üîí [SECURITY AUDIT] Employee query - User: {user.email}, Business: {business_id}")
```

### Metrics Tracked
- Cross-tenant access attempts
- NULL business_id queries
- Failed tenant context requests
- Suspicious query patterns

---

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Mistakes
1. **Never use `.all()`** without tenant filtering
2. **Never use custom managers** like `.all_objects` that bypass filtering
3. **Always ensure business_id is set** during user creation
4. **Always inherit from TenantAwareModel** for tenant-specific data
5. **Always use TenantIsolatedViewSet** for API endpoints

### Best Practices
1. **Multi-layer security**: Don't rely on a single layer of protection
2. **Audit regularly**: Use scripts to find security issues
3. **Log everything**: Security events must be logged and monitored
4. **Test with real users**: Monica's case revealed critical issues
5. **Fix root causes**: Don't just patch symptoms
