- **Privacy Law Compliance**: Must comply with GDPR, CCPA, and applicable local privacy laws
- **Data Access Rights**: Must provide employees access to their location data upon request
- **Limited Scope**: Location tracking MUST be limited to work hours and work locations only

### Employee Rights
**PROTECTED RIGHTS:**
- **Right to Opt-Out**: Can decline location tracking (may affect clock in/out capabilities)
- **Right to Know**: Must know what data is collected and how it's used
- **Right to Access**: Can request access to all their location data

## Geofencing Setup

### Admin Interface
**Location**: Settings â†’ Geofencing (Admin/Owner only)

### Setup Process
1. **Legal Compliance Acceptance**
   - Review employer responsibilities
   - Acknowledge employee rights
   - Accept legal obligations
   - Confirm GDPR compliance

2. **Geofence Creation**
   - Interactive Google Maps interface
   - Click-to-place geofence centers
   - Adjustable radius (10-1000 meters)
   - Visual feedback with colored circles

3. **Geofence Configuration**
   ```javascript
   {
     name: "Main Office",
     location_type: "office",
     radius: 100,
     require_for_clock_in: true,
     require_for_clock_out: true,
     auto_clock_out_on_exit: false,
     alert_on_unexpected_exit: true,
     is_active: true
   }
   ```

### Location Types
- **Office**: Standard office locations
- **Construction Site**: Construction and building sites
- **Client Location**: Client premises and facilities
- **Delivery Zone**: Delivery and pickup areas
- **Field Location**: Remote work locations
- **Custom**: User-defined location types

### Geofence Rules
- **Clock In Required**: Employee must be within geofence to clock in
- **Clock Out Required**: Employee must be within geofence to clock out
- **Auto Clock Out**: Automatically clock out when employee leaves geofence
- **Exit Alerts**: Send alerts when employee leaves during work hours

## Employee Experience

### Location Consent Flow
1. **First Clock In Attempt**
   - System detects no location consent
   - Displays comprehensive consent modal
   - Explains data collection and usage
   - Provides accept/decline options

2. **Consent Modal Content**
   ```
   What location data is collected:
   - GPS coordinates during clock in/out
   - Location accuracy information
   - Address information (if available)
   - Distance from work locations
   
   How data is used:
   - Verify presence at authorized work locations
   - Generate accurate time records
   - Ensure work location policy compliance
   - Improve workplace safety and security
   
   Your rights:
   - Decline location tracking
   - Access and delete location data
   - Work-hours only tracking
   - Encrypted secure storage
   - 90-day automatic deletion
   ```

### Clock In/Out Process
1. **Location Detection**
   - System requests location permission
   - GPS coordinates captured with high accuracy
   - Location accuracy and address resolved

2. **Geofence Validation**
   - Real-time check against active geofences
   - Distance calculations from geofence centers
   - Status indicators (inside/outside work areas)

3. **Action Enforcement**
   - Clock in/out blocked if outside required areas
   - Clear error messages with geofence information
   - Distance display showing how far from work area

### Status Indicators
- **ðŸŸ¢ Inside Work Area**: Employee within required geofence
- **ðŸ”´ Outside Work Area**: Employee outside required geofence
- **ðŸŸ¡ Location Unknown**: Unable to determine location
- **âšª No Requirements**: No geofence restrictions active
