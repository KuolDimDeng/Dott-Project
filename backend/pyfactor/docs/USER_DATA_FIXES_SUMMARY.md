# User Data Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Google OAuth Name Extraction
**Problem**: When users sign in with Google, the `given_name` and `family_name` fields were empty, causing user initials to show as "?" in the DashAppBar.

**Solution**: Enhanced the Auth0 user creation endpoint to:
- Extract names from multiple sources (given_name/family_name, name field, email)
- Apply intelligent fallbacks when Google doesn't provide separate name fields
- Always ensure users have at least a first name for display

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/api/views/auth0_views.py` - Enhanced name extraction logic in `Auth0UserCreateView`

### 2. Subscription Plan Not Saving
**Problem**: Users selecting paid plans (Professional/Enterprise) were showing as "free" in the DashAppBar.

**Solution**: 
- Added explicit save of subscription_plan to User model in `SubscriptionSaveView`
- This fix was already in place from earlier work

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/pyfactor/onboarding/views/subscription.py` - Lines 396-399 save subscription_plan

### 3. Onboarding Completion Name Updates
**Problem**: Names weren't being updated during the onboarding completion process.

**Solution**: Enhanced the complete-all endpoint to:
- Extract names from request data (given_name/family_name/first_name/last_name)
- Fall back to parsing the user.name field
- Use email prefix as final fallback
- Only update if better data is available

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/pyfactor/onboarding/api/views/complete_all_view.py` - Enhanced name extraction in `complete_all_onboarding`

## How the Fixes Work

### For New Users (Google Sign-In)
1. User signs in with Google via Auth0
2. Auth0 provides user data to our user-sync endpoint
3. Backend's `Auth0UserCreateView` receives the data and:
   - Tries to use `given_name` and `family_name` from Google
   - If not provided, parses the `name` field (e.g., "John Doe" → first_name="John", last_name="Doe")
   - If still no name, uses email prefix (e.g., "john@example.com" → first_name="John")
4. User completes onboarding and selects subscription plan
5. `SubscriptionSaveView` saves the plan to User.subscription_plan
6. `complete_all_onboarding` updates any missing name fields
7. DashAppBar displays correct initials and subscription plan

### Data Flow
```
Google OAuth → Auth0 → user-sync API → Auth0UserCreateView
                                      ↓
                                   User Model
                                   - first_name (from given_name or name or email)
                                   - last_name (from family_name or name)
                                   - subscription_plan (from onboarding)
                                      ↓
                                session-v2 API
                                      ↓
                                 DashAppBar
                                 - Shows initials from first_name/last_name
                                 - Shows subscription plan badge
```

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Test Google Sign-In**:
   - Sign up with a new Google account
   - Check that user initials appear correctly in DashAppBar
   - Verify in Django admin that User has first_name populated

2. **Test Subscription Selection**:
   - Complete onboarding with Professional or Enterprise plan
   - Verify the plan badge shows correctly in DashAppBar
   - Check User.subscription_plan in Django admin

3. **Test Email Fallback**:
   - Create account where Google doesn't provide name
   - Verify initials are generated from email prefix

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding a profile settings page where users can update their display name
2. Add validation to ensure subscription_plan matches OnboardingProgress records
3. Consider caching user data in Redis for faster dashboard loads
