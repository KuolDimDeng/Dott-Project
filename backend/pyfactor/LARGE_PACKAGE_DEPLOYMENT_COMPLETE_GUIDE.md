# Complete Guide: Deploying Large Application Packages to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

**Version: 1.0.0**  
**Last Updated: May 17, 2025**

## Overview

This guide addresses the challenge of deploying large application packages to AWS Elastic Beanstalk when you encounter the following error:

```
Source bundle is empty or exceeds maximum allowed size: 524288000 bytes
```

AWS Elastic Beanstalk has a 512MB (approximately 500MB) size limit for application bundles deployed directly through the EB CLI or AWS Console upload. Our application package is approximately 1.5GB, requiring special handling methods.

## Quick Start

1. **Prepare your deployment package**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/prepare_deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Prepare for AWS Console manual upload**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/prepare_for_manual_upload.sh
   ```

3. **Upload to S3 and deploy** using the step-by-step guides:
   - Follow `S3_UPLOAD_STEP_BY_STEP.md` for detailed S3 upload instructions
   - Then follow `AWS_CONSOLE_MANUAL_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` to complete the Elastic Beanstalk deployment

## The Problem

The AWS Elastic Beanstalk service has a hard limit of 512MB for application packages that are directly uploaded through either:
- The EB CLI (`eb deploy` command)
- The AWS Console direct upload feature

Our Docker-based application package is approximately 1.5GB (and may grow larger as features are added), so we need alternative deployment strategies.

## Solution Options

We've implemented four approaches to handle this limitation:

### Option 1: AWS Console Manual Upload via S3 (Recommended)

This approach uses Amazon S3 as an intermediary storage location to bypass the size limit:

1. Prepare your package using our script
2. Upload the package to an S3 bucket
3. Create an EB application version referencing your S3 object
4. Deploy the version to your environment

**Detailed Instructions:**
- `S3_UPLOAD_STEP_BY_STEP.md` - Visual guide for S3 upload
- `AWS_CONSOLE_MANUAL_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` - Complete AWS Console deployment workflow

**Helper Script:**
- `prepare_for_manual_upload.sh` - Creates a properly named package for AWS Console upload

### Option 2: EB CLI with S3 Direct Upload

Our enhanced EB CLI script automatically handles the size limitation by:
1. Detecting the package size
2. Uploading large packages directly to S3
3. Creating an application version that references the S3 object
4. Deploying the version to your environment

**Detailed Instructions:**
- `EB_CLI_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Guide for using EB CLI with S3 direct upload

**Helper Script:**
- `deploy_via_eb_cli.sh` - Automated EB deployment with S3 handling

### Option 3: AWS CLI Direct Deployment

This approach uses the AWS CLI to directly create application versions and environments, bypassing the AWS Console UI:
1. Prepare your package using our script
2. Run the AWS CLI deployment script which handles:
   - Creating an application version referencing your S3 object
   - Creating or updating your environment
   - Monitoring deployment status

**Detailed Instructions:**
- `AWS_CLI_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide for AWS CLI-based deployment

**Helper Script:**
- `aws_cli_deploy.sh` - Automated AWS CLI deployment script

### Option 4: Package Size Reduction (Last Resort)

If all S3-based approaches fail, you can create a minimal package:
1. Reduces package size to under 500MB
2. Includes only essential configuration files
3. Modifies deployment scripts to fetch the full application during deployment

**Detailed Instructions:**
- `PACKAGE_SIZE_REDUCTION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for package size reduction

**Helper Script:**
- `reduce_package_size.sh` - Creates minimal deployment package

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Workflow 1: Manual Upload via AWS Console (Recommended)

1. **Prepare your deployment package**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/prepare_deployment.sh
   ```
   This creates a Docker deployment package with all necessary fixes applied.

2. **Prepare for manual upload**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/prepare_for_manual_upload.sh
   ```
   This creates a properly named copy of your package for AWS Console upload.

3. **Upload to Amazon S3**:
   - Follow detailed steps in `S3_UPLOAD_STEP_BY_STEP.md`
   - Key steps: Create S3 bucket, upload file, note the S3 URL

4. **Create Elastic Beanstalk Application Version**:
   - Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk Console
   - Go to Application → Application Versions
   - Create a new application version referencing your S3 object
   - Full details in `AWS_CONSOLE_MANUAL_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`

5. **Deploy to Environment**:
   - From the Application Versions page, select your new version
   - Click Actions → Deploy
   - Select your target environment
   - Complete the deployment

### Workflow 2: EB CLI Direct Upload (Alternative)

1. **Prepare your deployment package**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/prepare_deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy using the EB CLI script**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   ./scripts/deploy_via_eb_cli.sh
   ```
   This script automatically handles S3 upload for large packages.

3. **Monitor deployment**:
   - The script will output status updates
   - You can also monitor in the AWS Console

### Workflow 3: AWS CLI Direct Deployment

1. **Prepare your deployment package**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/prepare_deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Upload the package to S3** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   ./backend/pyfactor/scripts/prepare_for_manual_upload.sh
   # Then follow the S3 upload guide (S3_UPLOAD_STEP_BY_STEP.md)
   ```

3. **Update AWS CLI deployment script with your S3 details**:
   Edit the script to update the S3 bucket and key variables:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   # Edit scripts/aws_cli_deploy.sh to update:
   # S3_BUCKET="your-bucket-name"
   # S3_KEY="your-file-name.zip"
   ```

4. **Run the AWS CLI deployment script**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   ./scripts/aws_cli_deploy.sh
   ```
   This script handles the entire deployment process via direct AWS CLI commands.

5. **Monitor deployment process**:
   - The script will output status updates and poll for completion
   - You can also monitor in the AWS Console

## Troubleshooting

### "No space left on device" Error

If you see this error when running the preparation scripts:
- This is due to the large file size and limited disk space
- Try freeing up disk space or use a system with more available space
- The AWS S3 upload will still work as long as you have the original deployment package

### S3 Upload Fails

If your S3 upload fails:
- Check your AWS credentials and permissions
- Consider using the AWS CLI for more reliable large file uploads:
  ```bash
  aws s3 cp /path/to/package.zip s3://your-bucket-name/
  ```
- See `S3_UPLOAD_STEP_BY_STEP.md` for troubleshooting tips

### "Application Version Not Found" Error

If deployment fails with "application version not found":
- Ensure the application name in EB CLI matches your actual application
- Verify the version was created successfully in the AWS Console
- Check AWS IAM permissions for your account

## Best Practices

1. **Use proper version labeling**
   - Our scripts automatically add timestamps to version labels
   - This prevents confusion with multiple deployments

2. **Monitor deployment logs**
   - Check EB event logs for detailed deployment information
   - Use CloudWatch Logs for application runtime logs

3. **Consider package size optimization**
   - Use `.ebignore` and `.dockerignore` files
   - Exclude unnecessary files like node_modules, __pycache__, etc.
   - Use multi-stage Docker builds

4. **AWS resources cleanup**
   - Delete old application versions periodically 
   - Remove unused S3 objects to avoid storage costs

## Conclusion

The AWS Elastic Beanstalk 512MB package size limit can be challenging for large Docker applications, but we've provided four robust methods to overcome this limitation:

1. **AWS Console upload via S3** - Most reliable visual method
2. **EB CLI with S3 direct upload** - Good automation option
3. **AWS CLI Direct Deployment** - Bypasses UI issues, highly reliable for automation
4. **Package size reduction** - Last resort for extreme cases

Each approach is documented with detailed guides and supporting scripts to ensure successful deployments regardless of package size.
