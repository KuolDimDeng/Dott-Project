Script: Version0002_BankingModels_LinterNotes.py
Date: 2025-04-28

Description:
This script documents the known issue with linter errors in the banking/models.py file
regarding the dynamic import of FinanceTransaction from another app.

Issue:
The linter reports "FinanceTransaction" is unknown import symbol when importing it dynamically
within a method. This is a limitation of the linter, not an actual code issue, as the
runtime behavior will work correctly. The dynamic import is necessary to avoid circular
dependencies between banking and finance apps.

Known Linter Errors:
- Line 89: "FinanceTransaction" is unknown import symbol, severity: 1

Solution: 
We accept this linter error as it's a false positive. The dynamic import is the correct
pattern to avoid circular dependencies between Django apps. At runtime, the code will
work correctly by importing the model only when needed, and the try/except block
handles cases where the finance app is not available.

Alternative Solutions Considered:
1. Creating a fake/placeholder FinanceTransaction class - causes other linter issues
2. Moving the import to the top - causes actual circular import errors at runtime
3. Using Django's apps.get_model - more complex and not worth the extra complexity
