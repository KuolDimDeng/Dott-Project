# Business ID CORS Headers Fix

## Overview
This document describes the fix for CORS-related issues affecting the Business ID headers in the Django backend. The issue manifests as Cross-Origin Request Blocked errors in the browser when the frontend attempts to make API requests with `x-business-id` headers.

## Problem Description
When the frontend makes API requests to the backend with specific headers related to tenant and business ID, CORS preflight checks fail with the following error:

```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://127.0.0.1:8000/api/hr/employees. 
(Reason: header 'x-business-id' is not allowed according to header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' from CORS preflight response).
```

This error occurs because:
1. The frontend includes the `x-business-id` header in requests
2. The Django CORS configuration (in settings.py) is either missing this header in the allowed headers list or has a syntax error in the configuration
3. The browser's security mechanisms block the request due to the CORS validation failure

## Solution
The `Version0006_fix_cors_headers_for_business_id.py` script addresses this issue by:

1. Creating a backup of the settings.py file
2. Identifying and fixing any syntax errors in the CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS list
3. Ensuring that all variations of the business ID header (`x-business-id`, `X-Business-ID`, `X-BUSINESS-ID`) are included in the allowed headers
4. Adding the business ID header to the exposed headers list for response headers
5. Properly formatting the header lists with correct syntax

## Implementation
The script uses regular expressions to identify the CORS header configurations in settings.py and makes precise modifications to include the required headers. The script also checks for missing closing brackets in the list declarations, which can cause syntax errors when the Django server starts.

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor/scripts
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Version0006_fix_cors_headers_for_business_id.py
   ```

3. Follow the instructions to restart the Django server:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server with Ctrl+C
   python run_server.py
   ```

## Verification
After applying the fix:

1. The server should start without any syntax errors
2. The employee data should load correctly in the frontend
3. The browser console should not show CORS-related errors for the business ID header

## Technical Background

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. When making cross-origin requests, the browser sends a preflight request (OPTIONS) to determine if the actual request is safe to send.

### Headers in CORS
For custom headers like `x-business-id`, the server must explicitly allow these headers in its CORS configuration. This is done through the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header during the preflight check.
