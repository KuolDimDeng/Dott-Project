# Owner Permission Fix

## Issue Description

When a user with the role of 'owner' attempts to add an employee, they receive a permission denied error, despite the fact that owners should have the privilege to add employees.

The error message is:
```
Permission denied: User with role owner tried to create employee
```

## Root Cause Analysis

Upon investigation, we found that the issue was related to case sensitivity in the role comparison.

In the `hr/views.py` file, there is a permission check:

```python
if user_role.upper() != 'owner':
    logger.error(f"Permission denied: User with role {user_role} tried to create employee")
    return Response(
        {"error": "Only owners can create employees"},
        status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
    )
```

The problem is:
1. `user_role.upper()` converts the role to uppercase (e.g., "OWNER")
2. But it's being compared to the lowercase string 'owner'
3. This comparison will always fail even if the user is an owner

## Solution

The fix is to update the comparison to ensure proper case handling:

```python
if user_role.upper() != 'OWNER':
    logger.error(f"Permission denied: User with role {user_role} tried to create employee")
    return Response(
        {"error": "Only owners can create employees"},
        status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
    )
```

This ensures that:
1. The role is converted to uppercase
2. The comparison string is also in uppercase
3. The comparison will work correctly regardless of the case stored in the database

## Implementation

The fix is implemented in the `Version0001_Fix_Owner_Employee_Permission.py` script, which:

1. Creates a backup of the original `hr/views.py` file
2. Modifies all instances of case-sensitive role comparisons
3. Logs the changes made
4. Updates the script registry with execution information

## Execution Instructions

To apply the fix:

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor/scripts
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python Version0001_Fix_Owner_Employee_Permission.py
   ```

3. Restart the Django server:
   ```
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   python run_server.py
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix, the owner should be able to add employees without permission issues.

To verify:
1. Log in as a user with the 'owner' role
2. Navigate to the HR/Employees section
3. Add a new employee
4. The process should complete without permission errors
