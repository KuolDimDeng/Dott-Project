# Tenant Isolation Fix Documentation

## Issue: Data Leakage Between Tenants

**Date**: 2025-04-29
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Author**: Claude AI Assistant

## Problem Description

A critical data leakage vulnerability was identified where a user from one tenant could see employee data from another tenant. Specifically, when user `kdeng@dottapps.com` logged in, they could see employee data that was created by another user `kuoldimdeng@outlook.com` from a different tenant.

This issue was a serious security breach in the application's multi-tenant isolation mechanism.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, the following issues were identified:

1. **Missing Tenant Filtering**: The `employee_list` view in `hr/views.py` was using `Employee.objects.all()` without tenant filtering, which returned all employees from all tenants.

2. **AllowAny Permission Class**: The endpoint was decorated with `@permission_classes([AllowAny])`, allowing unauthenticated access without proper tenant context.

3. **RLS Not Applied**: While Row Level Security (RLS) was enabled on many tables, the application code was bypassing RLS by not setting the tenant context or by using direct unfiltered queries.

## Solution Implemented

Two scripts were created to fix the issue:

### 1. Frontend Fix Script: `Version0001_fix_employee_rls_views.js`

This script modifies the `employee_list` function in `hr/views.py` to filter employees by tenant ID:

```python
# Instead of:
employees = Employee.objects.all()

# Changed to:
# Get tenant ID from request or headers
tenant_id = getattr(request, 'tenant_id', None)
if not tenant_id:
    tenant_id = request.headers.get('X-Tenant-ID') or request.headers.get('x-tenant-id')

# If tenant_id is provided, filter by it for RLS isolation
if tenant_id:
    # Filter employees by tenant_id for proper RLS isolation
    employees = Employee.objects.filter(business_id=tenant_id)
    logger.info(f"Filtered employees by tenant: {tenant_id}")
else:
    # Only return employees for the authenticated user's tenant
    # This is a fallback and should not normally happen when RLS is properly set
    logger.warning("No tenant ID found in request, returning empty employee list for security")
    employees = Employee.objects.none()
```

### 2. Backend Fix Script: `Version0001_enforce_tenant_isolation.py`

This script provides a comprehensive fix to tenant isolation issues:

1. **Ensures RLS Functions**: Verifies that all necessary RLS PostgreSQL functions exist
2. **Checks Tenant-Aware Tables**: Identifies all tables with tenant_id or business_id columns
3. **Enables RLS**: Enables Row Level Security on all tenant-aware tables 
4. **Creates RLS Policies**: Adds proper tenant isolation policies to all tables
5. **Fixes Employee View**: Updates the employee list view to filter by tenant
6. **Tests Isolation**: Validates tenant isolation is working correctly

## How RLS Works in Our Application

Row Level Security (RLS) is PostgreSQL's feature that restricts which rows a user can see based on a policy. Our implementation:

1. **Session Variables**: We use PostgreSQL session variables to track the current tenant:
   ```sql
   SET app.current_tenant_id = 'tenant-uuid-here';
   ```

2. **RLS Policies**: We apply RLS policies to tenant-aware tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON table_name
   USING (tenant_id::TEXT = get_tenant_context());
   ```

3. **Middleware**: The `EnhancedRowLevelSecurityMiddleware` sets the tenant context for each request based on:
   - The authenticated user's tenant ID
   - The X-Tenant-ID header
   - The tenant ID in the URL path

4. **Fallback in Code**: Even with RLS enabled, we added explicit tenant filtering in application code as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Verification Steps

To verify that the tenant isolation fix is working properly:

1. **Run the Fix Scripts**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend fix
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/scripts
   node Version0001_fix_employee_rls_views.js

   # Backend fix
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor
   python scripts/Version0001_enforce_tenant_isolation.py --fix
   ```

2. **Restart the Application**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx
   python run_server.py
   ```

3. **Test with Multiple Tenants**:
   - Log in as `kdeng@dottapps.com`
   - Verify they can only see employees from their tenant
   - Log in as another user from a different tenant
   - Verify cross-tenant data is not visible

## Preventive Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Code Review Checklist**: Add RLS validation to code review checklist
2. **RLS Unit Tests**: Implement automated tests to verify tenant isolation
3. **Static Analysis**: Configure linting to flag unfiltered queries on tenant-aware models
4. **Security Scanning**: Regular security audits to check for tenant isolation issues
