# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Docker Deployment Solution

This README documents the comprehensive solution for deploying the PyFactor Django backend to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Docker.

## Problem Summary

We encountered several issues when trying to deploy our Django application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Docker:

1. **Port mismatch**: Dockerfile used port 8080, but Dockerrun.aws.json specified port 8000
2. **Package size**: Full packages exceeded AWS Elastic Beanstalk's 500MB limit
3. **Configuration errors**: WSGI parameters were incompatible with Docker deployments
4. **Python setup issues**: Problems with Python configuration in the Docker environment

## Solution Components

Our solution consists of several scripts that work together to address these issues:

1. **Version0038_docker_eb_comprehensive_fix.js**: The main script that fixes all identified issues
2. **install_dependencies.sh**: Script to install required Node.js dependencies
3. **deploy_docker_eb.sh**: Script to automate the deployment process

## Quick Start

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor/scripts
   ```

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_docker_eb.sh
   ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to complete the deployment

## Solution Details

### 1. Port Configuration Fix

The script fixes the port mismatch by updating Dockerrun.aws.json to use port 8080, which matches the port specified in the Dockerfile:

```json
"Ports": [
  {
    "ContainerPort": 8080,
    "HostPort": 8080
  }
]
```

### 2. Package Size Reduction

The script creates a minimal deployment package that includes only essential files:
- `.platform/` - AWS platform hooks
- `.ebextensions/` - AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration
- `Dockerrun.aws.json` - EB Docker configuration
- Essential application files

### 3. Configuration Compatibility

The script removes incompatible WSGI parameters and Python-specific configurations that don't apply to Docker:
- Removed `WSGIPath`, `NumProcesses`, and `NumThreads` parameters
- Removed Python-specific platform settings

### 4. Python Environment

The Docker container uses the official Python 3.12 slim image with proper dependency configuration.

- [DOCKER_BASED_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md](DOCKER_BASED_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md) - General Docker deployment guidelines

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check the Elastic Beanstalk environment logs
2. Verify that all environment variables are correctly configured
3. Ensure database connection settings are correct
4. Check the Docker container logs for specific errors

## Maintenance

To keep deployments running smoothly:

1. Always use the minimal package approach
2. Maintain port consistency between Dockerfile and Dockerrun.aws.json
3. Update the deployment scripts as AWS Elastic Beanstalk requirements change
4. Consider setting up CI/CD for automated deployments
