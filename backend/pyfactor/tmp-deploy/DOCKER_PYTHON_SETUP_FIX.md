# Docker Python Setup Fix

## Problem Identified

During deployment of our Docker application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the following error occurred:

```
ERROR: Command .platform/hooks/prebuild/01_install_dependencies.sh failed with error exit status 127.
Stderr:+ exec
++ tee -a /var/log/eb-prebuild.log
```

Examining the logs revealed two issues:
```
.platform/hooks/prebuild/01_install_dependencies.sh: line 18: python: command not found
...
.platform/hooks/prebuild/01_install_dependencies.sh: line 59: pip: command not found
```

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Python in Docker Environment**: The Docker container didn't have Python and pip installed, which are required for the deployment process.

2. **Shell Script Syntax Errors**: Similar to the PostgreSQL script error we fixed previously, the `01_install_dependencies.sh` script also contained shell syntax errors with inline comments inside if statements:

```bash
# Problematic code - comments inside the if condition:
if ! sudo yum install -y libpq-devel # Replaced libpq-devel # Replaced postgresql-devel for AL2023 compatibility for AL2023 compatibility; then
    # ...
fi
```

## Solution

1. **Improved Dockerfile**:
   - Added explicit installation of Python 3 and pip in the Dockerfile
   - Created alternatives symlinks for python and pip commands
   - Added proper system dependencies needed for Python packages

2. **Fixed Dependencies Script**:
   - Moved inline comments to their own lines
   - Fixed shell syntax errors in the if statements
   - Ensured script has proper execute permissions

## Implementation

1. Created backup copies of the original Dockerfile and dependencies script
2. Updated the Dockerfile to include Python installation
3. Fixed syntax errors in the dependencies script
4. Created a new deployment package with both fixes

## New Deployment Package

A new fixed deployment package has been created:
`docker-eb-package-python-fixed-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.zip`

This package contains:
1. The fixed PostgreSQL script from our previous fix
2. The fixed dependencies script with proper shell syntax
3. An improved Dockerfile that properly installs Python and pip
4. All other previous fixes

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the application with this fix:

1. Use the AWS Management Console
2. Create a new environment or update an existing one
3. Upload the package with the Docker Python setup fix
4. Make sure to select 'nginx' as the proxy server
5. Follow the detailed instructions in `AWS_CONSOLE_UPLOAD_STEPS_DOCKER.md`

This fix ensures that Python is properly available in the Docker environment and the dependencies script runs correctly during deployment.
