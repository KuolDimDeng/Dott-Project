eb-deploy-optimized-20250529_085216.zip
   - Version label: EB-Deploy-Optimized-20250529_085216
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Watch the Events tab for deployment progress
   - Expected deployment time: 5-10 minutes
   - Health status should show "Ok" when complete

### Option 2: EB CLI Deployment
```bash
# Initialize EB (if not already done)
eb init Dott --region us-east-1 --platform docker

# Deploy the package
eb deploy Dott-env-fixed --staged
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Check
- URL: https://Dott-env-fixed.eba-yek4sdqp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/health/
- Expected Response: {"status": "healthy", ...}

### 2. Application Access
- Main URL: https://Dott-env-fixed.eba-yek4sdqp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

### 3. Logs Monitoring
- Check CloudWatch logs for any errors
- Monitor application performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:
1. **Check Events Tab** in AWS Console for specific error messages
2. **Review Logs** in CloudWatch or download bundle logs
3. **Verify Health Endpoint** is responding
4. **Check Docker Build** process in deployment logs

### Common Issues and Solutions:
- **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout in EB configuration
- **Health Check Failures**: Verify /health/ endpoint is accessible
- **Build Failures**: Check Dockerfile and requirements-eb.txt
- **Size Errors**: Further optimize .dockerignore exclusions

### Rollback Procedure:
If deployment fails, you can rollback via AWS Console:
1. Go to Application Versions
2. Select previous working version
3. Click "Deploy" to rollback

## Configuration Files Modified:
- Dockerfile (optimized for production)
- Dockerrun.aws.json (minimal configuration)
- .dockerignore (comprehensive exclusions)
- .ebextensions/01_docker_health.config (health monitoring)

## Support:
- Environment: Dott-env-fixed.eba-yek4sdqp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
- AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/
- Health Check: https://Dott-env-fixed.eba-yek4sdqp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/health/
