# Business Registration Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of business registration flow from consumer mode in the mobile app, ensuring proper backend integration, user role updates, tenant creation, and automatic marketplace registration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Changes (`/backend/pyfactor/users/views_business_registration.py`)

#### Key Updates:
- **User Role Update**: Sets user role to 'OWNER' when business is created
- **Tenant Creation**: Business ID becomes the tenant ID
- **UserProfile Update**: Updates or creates UserProfile with business ownership flags
- **Marketplace Registration**: Automatically creates BusinessListing in marketplace
- **has_business Computation**: Dynamically computed based on Business records

#### Code Changes:
```python
# Update User role to OWNER
user.role = 'OWNER'
user.save(update_fields=['role'])

# Auto-register in marketplace
marketplace_listing = BusinessListing.objects.create(
    business=user,
    business_type=business_type or 'OTHER',
    delivery_scope='local',
    is_active=True,
    is_verified=False,
    accepts_online_orders=True,
    accepts_cash=True,
    accepts_mobile_money=True,
    minimum_order_amount=0,
    average_rating=0.0,
    total_reviews=0,
    total_orders=0
)

# Compute has_business dynamically
has_business = Business.objects.filter(owner_id=user.id).exists()
```

### 2. Mobile App Changes

#### BusinessRegistrationScreen (`/src/screens/consumer/BusinessRegistrationScreen.js`)
- **Success Handling**: Properly handles API response
- **User Context Update**: Calls `fetchUserProfile()` to refresh user data
- **Success Message**: Confirms OWNER role and marketplace registration

```javascript
// Update user context with new business info
if (response.success && response.data) {
    // Update the user in auth context
    await fetchUserProfile();
    
    Alert.alert(
        'Success',
        `Your business "${response.data.business_name}" has been registered successfully! You are now set as the OWNER and your business is listed in the marketplace.`,
        [...]
    );
}
```

#### AuthContext (`/src/context/AuthContext.js`)
- **fetchUserProfile**: Already properly updates user data including has_business
- **Mode Switching**: Automatically switches to business mode when has_business is true

### 3. Data Flow

1. **User Registration Process**:
   - Consumer user clicks "Register Business" in Account screen
   - Fills out 5-step registration form
   - Submits to `/users/business/register` endpoint

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Creates Business record with owner_id = user.id
   - Updates/creates UserProfile with business_id and tenant_id
   - Sets user.role = 'OWNER'
   - Creates BusinessListing in marketplace (auto-registered)
   - Returns success with updated user info

3. **Frontend Update**:
   - Receives success response
   - Calls fetchUserProfile() to refresh user context
   - User sees success message
   - Navigation tabs update (Business menu appears instead of Purchases)
   - User can now access business features

### 4. Key Models & Fields

#### User Model:
- `role`: Set to 'OWNER' when business created
- `business_id`: UUID of the business
- Note: `has_business` is NOT a field, it's computed dynamically

#### Business Model:
- `owner_id`: User ID who owns the business
- `name`: Business name
- `entity_type`: INDIVIDUAL, SMALL_BUSINESS, etc.
- `business_type`: SERVICE, RETAIL, MIXED, OTHER

#### UserProfile Model:
- `business_id`: Links to Business
- `tenant_id`: Same as business_id for isolation
- `is_business_owner`: Set to True
- `role`: Set to 'OWNER'

#### BusinessListing Model (Marketplace):
- `business`: Links to User
- `business_type`: Category for marketplace
- `is_active`: True by default
- `is_verified`: False (needs admin verification)

### 5. Verification Steps

To verify the implementation works:

1. **Check User Role**: After registration, user.role should be 'OWNER'
2. **Check Business Creation**: Business record exists with correct owner_id
3. **Check UserProfile**: Updated with business_id and tenant_id
4. **Check Marketplace**: BusinessListing created and active
5. **Check Mobile UI**: Business menu appears, user mode switches to business

### 6. API Response Format

Successful registration returns:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Business created successfully",
    "data": {
        "business_id": "uuid",
        "business_name": "Business Name",
        "entity_type": "SMALL_BUSINESS",
        "is_business_owner": true,
        "has_business": true,
        "role": "OWNER",
        "offers_courier_services": false,
        "marketplace_registered": true,
        "tenant_id": "uuid",
        "user": {
            "id": 123,
            "email": "user@example.com",
            "has_business": true,
            "role": "OWNER"
        }
    }
}
```
