# üöÄ DUAL QR SYSTEM - Complete Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Revolutionary dual QR system where EVERY user has TWO QR codes:
1. **Payment QR** - To pay others (already implemented)
2. **Receive QR** - To get paid (NEW - game changer!)

This creates a complete circular economy where everyone can be both customer AND merchant.

## üéØ Vision: "Everyone Can Pay and Get Paid"

### The Game-Changing Innovation
```
Traditional: Business OR Consumer
Dott Pay: Business AND Consumer (Same Person!)
```

## üìê System Architecture

### Current State (What We Have)
```python
DottPayProfile:
  - payment_qr_code (‚úÖ Implemented)
  - linked_payment_methods (‚úÖ Implemented)
  - transaction_limits (‚úÖ Implemented)
```

### Future State (What We're Building)
```python
DottPayProfile:
  - payment_qr_code (existing)
  - receive_qr_code (NEW)
  - merchant_profile (NEW)
  - payout_methods (NEW)
  
MerchantProfile:
  - business_name
  - merchant_category
  - static_qr_code
  - dynamic_qr_capability
  - settlement_accounts
```

## üõ† Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Models (Week 1)

#### New Models to Create

```python
# backend/pyfactor/payments/models_dual_qr.py

class MerchantProfile(TenantAwareModel):
    """Every user can be a merchant"""
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, related_name='merchant_profile')
    merchant_id = models.CharField(unique=True)  # MER_xxxxx
    business_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    business_type = models.CharField(choices=BUSINESS_TYPES)
    
    # Receive QR Configuration
    receive_qr_id = models.UUIDField(unique=True)
    static_qr_code = models.TextField()  # Permanent QR
    dynamic_qr_enabled = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    
    # Settlement Configuration
    settlement_method = models.CharField(choices=['instant', 'daily', 'weekly'])
    settlement_accounts = models.JSONField()  # Bank, M-Pesa, MTN details
    
    # Pricing
    is_premium = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    custom_branding = models.JSONField(null=True)  # Logo, colors
    
    # Analytics
    total_received = models.DecimalField(default=0)
    transaction_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    
class ReceiveTransaction(TenantAwareModel):
    """Tracks money received via QR"""
    merchant = models.ForeignKey(MerchantProfile)
    payer = models.ForeignKey(User)
    amount = models.DecimalField()
    qr_type = models.CharField(choices=['static', 'dynamic'])
    reference = models.CharField()
    status = models.CharField()
    settlement_status = models.CharField()
    
class QRCode(TenantAwareModel):
    """Manages both QR types"""
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)
    qr_type = models.CharField(choices=['payment', 'receive'])
    qr_data = models.TextField()
    is_static = models.BooleanField()
    expires_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
    scan_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
```

### Phase 2: API Endpoints (Week 1-2)

#### New Endpoints to Build

```python
# Consumer APIs
GET  /api/dott-pay/my-qr-codes/          # Get both QR codes
POST /api/dott-pay/scan/                 # Universal scanner
GET  /api/dott-pay/transaction-history/  # All transactions

# Merchant APIs

GET  /api/dott-pay/merchant/receive-qr/  # Get receive QR
POST /api/dott-pay/merchant/generate-dynamic-qr/  # Dynamic QR
GET  /api/dott-pay/merchant/settlements/ # Settlement history
POST /api/dott-pay/merchant/withdraw/    # Manual withdrawal

# P2P APIs

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes Needed

```python
# 1. Update DottPayProfile model
class DottPayProfile(TenantAwareModel):
    # Existing fields...
    
    # NEW: Receive QR fields
    receive_qr_id = models.UUIDField(unique=True)
    receive_qr_static = models.TextField()
    merchant_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    is_merchant = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    merchant_category = models.CharField(choices=CATEGORIES)
    
    # NEW: Settlement configuration
    settlement_method = models.CharField()
    bank_account = models.ForeignKey('BankAccount', null=True)
    mpesa_number = models.CharField(null=True)
    mtn_number = models.CharField(null=True)

# 2. Create QR generation service
class QRService:
    def generate_payment_qr(user):
        # Existing implementation
        
    def generate_receive_qr(user, qr_type='static'):
        # NEW: Generate receive QR
        
    def generate_dynamic_qr(user, amount, reference):
        # NEW: One-time QR with amount

# 3. Create settlement service  
class SettlementService:
    def process_instant(transaction):
        # Instant settlement for premium
        
    def process_batch():
        # Daily batch for free tier
        
    def calculate_fees(amount, user_type):
        # Fee calculation logic
```

### Mobile App Changes
