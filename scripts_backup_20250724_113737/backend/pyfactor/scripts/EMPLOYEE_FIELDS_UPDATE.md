# Employee Fields Update

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to the Employee model in the HR module to add new fields and update existing ones.

## Changes Made

1. **Added New Fields**:
   - `ID_verified`: Boolean field (true/false) with default value of false
   - `areManager`: Boolean field (true/false) with default value of false
   - `supervising`: Field to track one or more employees being supervised by this employee, defaulting to null

2. **Updated Existing Field**:
   - `supervisor`: Updated to default to the business owner for employees without a supervisor

## Implementation Details

The changes were implemented using the script `Version0001_add_employee_fields_hr_employee.py`, which:

1. Updates the Employee model in `models.py`
2. Creates a migration file to update the database schema
3. Applies the migration to update the AWS RDS database
4. Sets the default supervisor for existing employees to the business owner

## Database Impact

The script modifies the `hr_employee` table in the AWS RDS database by:

1. Adding new columns for the new fields
2. Updating the `supervisor` field for existing records where it's null

## Execution

To execute the script:

1. Navigate to the scripts directory: `cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/backend/pyfactor/scripts`
2. Activate the virtual environment if needed: `source ../../../.venv/bin/activate`
3. Run the script: `python Version0001_add_employee_fields_hr_employee.py`

## Rollback

If needed, the script creates backups of modified files with timestamps in their names. These can be used to roll back changes if necessary.

## Version History

## Notes

- The script includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- All changes are made within a transaction to ensure database consistency
