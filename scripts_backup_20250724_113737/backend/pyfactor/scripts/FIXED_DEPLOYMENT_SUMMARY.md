# Deployment Script Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed in Version0072_deploy_fixed_package.sh

### 1. Bash-specific Syntax Issue
- **Problem**: The script was using bash-specific syntax for lowercase conversion `${APPLICATION_NAME,,}` which is not compatible with all shell environments.
- **Solution**: Replaced with a manually defined lowercase variable `APP_NAME_LOWER="dottapps"` to ensure compatibility across different shell environments.

### 2. Deprecated AWS CLI Parameter Format
- **Problem**: The script was using `--process=false` parameter which is not supported in the current AWS CLI version.
- **Solution**: Updated to use the correct parameter format `--no-process`.

## Deployment Results
- The script successfully created and uploaded the package to S3
- Created a new application version in Elastic Beanstalk
- Updated the existing environment with the new version
- Deployment completed with status "Ready" but health "Red"

## Next Steps
- Check the AWS Elastic Beanstalk console and logs to investigate the "Red" health status
- Monitor the application for a few minutes as it might still be initializing
- Review the environment configuration to ensure all settings are correct

## Backup Information
- A backup of the original script was created before modifications: `Version0072_deploy_fixed_package.sh_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.bak`
