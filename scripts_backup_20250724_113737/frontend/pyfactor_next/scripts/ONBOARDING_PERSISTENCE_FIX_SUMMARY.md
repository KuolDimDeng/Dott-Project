# Onboarding Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem

When users sign out and sign back in after completing onboarding, they are incorrectly redirected back to the onboarding process instead of the dashboard.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurs because:

1. During sign out, all session cookies are cleared without preserving key onboarding status information
2. When signing back in, the system has no way to determine if onboarding was previously completed
3. The default behavior is to start onboarding from the beginning when status cannot be determined

## Solution Implemented

The fix implemented in Version0111_fix_post_signout_onboarding_redirect.mjs addresses this issue by:

1. **Enhanced Onboarding Status Persistence**
   - Added multiple layers of persistence for onboarding completion status
   - Implemented local storage caching for client-side persistence
   - Added additional user attributes in Auth0 for server-side persistence

2. **Improved Auth0 Logout/Login Flow**
   - Modified logout handler to extract and preserve onboarding status before clearing session
   - Updated login callback to carry forward preserved onboarding status
   - Added URL parameter handling to maintain onboarding status across the sign-out/sign-in cycle

3. **New Tenant Utilities**
   - Added utility functions in tenantUtils.js for consistent handling of onboarding status
   - Implemented persistOnboardingStatus() and getPersistedOnboardingStatus() functions

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files:
- `src/app/api/onboarding/status/route.js`: Enhanced onboarding status persistence and retrieval
- `src/app/api/auth/[...auth0]/route.js`: Updated Auth0 handlers to preserve onboarding status
- `src/utils/tenantUtils.js`: Added utility functions for onboarding status persistence

### Key Changes:
- Added URL parameter handling for preserved onboarding status
- Implemented multiple layers of persistence (Auth0 attributes, cookies, localStorage)
- Enhanced error handling for more robust onboarding status retrieval

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:
1. Sign in with a Google account
2. Complete the onboarding process
3. Sign out
4. Sign back in with the same account
5. Verify you are directed to the dashboard, not onboarding

## Future Improvements

For further robustness, consider:
1. Moving onboarding status to a database table for more reliable persistence
2. Implementing a server-side cache for onboarding status
3. Adding explicit API endpoints for querying onboarding status by user ID
