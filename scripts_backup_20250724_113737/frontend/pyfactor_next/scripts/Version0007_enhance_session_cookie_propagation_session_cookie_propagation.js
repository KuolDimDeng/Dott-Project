/**
 * Script: Version0007_enhance_session_cookie_propagation
 * Purpose: Enhance session verification to handle cookie propagation delays
 * Date: 2025-01-17
 * 
 * Issue:
 * Session verification was failing with "Session not ready after multiple attempts" because
 * cookies set with domain ".dottapps.com" take time to propagate across the browser's cookie storage.
 * 
 * Root Cause:
 * 1. Cookies set with a specific domain need time to propagate
 * 2. The verify-session-ready endpoint was checking too quickly
 * 3. No fallback for when session_token is available but main cookie isn't
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 1. Added 1-second initial delay before verification starts
 * 2. Enhanced verify-session-ready to check multiple cookie types
 * 3. Added support for status cookie detection
 * 4. Force fresh cookie read using await cookies()
 * 5. Added debug logging for better troubleshooting
 * 
 * Changes:
 * 1. Updated: /src/app/api/auth/verify-session-ready/route.js
 *    - Force fresh cookie read with await cookies()
 *    - Check for session_token and onboarding_status cookies
 *    - Better handling of cookies in propagation
 * 2. Updated: /src/components/auth/EmailPasswordSignIn.js
 *    - Added 1-second initial delay for cookie propagation
 *    - Enhanced debug logging
 *    - Better handling of retry responses

console.log('‚úÖ Added cookie propagation delay');
console.log('   - 1-second initial delay before verification');
console.log('   - Allows cookies to fully propagate across browser storage\n');

console.log('‚úÖ Enhanced session verification');
console.log('   - Force fresh cookie read with await cookies()');
console.log('   - Check multiple cookie types (dott_auth_session, session_token, onboarding_status)');

console.log('üîß How it works:');
console.log('1. User signs in and session cookies are set');
console.log('2. EmailPasswordSignIn waits 1 second for propagation');
console.log('3. Verification checks multiple cookie types');
console.log('4. If status cookie exists, knows session is being set');
