# Personal Information Tab Implementation Fix

## Issue Description

After previous fixes, the personal information tab in the EmployeeManagement component was still not displaying user data:

1. **Authentication Issues Persisted**: 
   - API requests to `/api/user/profile` continued to return 401 Unauthorized errors
   - Previous fixes attempted to add authentication headers but didn't fully resolve the issue
   - Console logs showed: `No user data found, using defaults`

2. **UI Organization Problems**:
   - User data and employee management were mixed in the same view without clear separation
   - The component architecture made it difficult to isolate and fix only the personal information section

## Fix Implementation

The fix script (Version0003_DirectFixForPersonalInfoTab_EmployeeManagement.js) implements a more comprehensive solution:

### 1. Dedicated PersonalInfoTab Component

- Created a completely standalone component specifically for personal information display
- Component directly accesses Cognito attributes without relying on API connectivity
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for proper data loading and state management
- Implements loading, error, and empty states for a better user experience

### 2. Proper Tab-Based Navigation

- Implemented tab-based navigation to separate personal information from employee management
- Set Personal Information as the default tab for immediate visibility
- Created a clean, modern tab interface using Tailwind CSS
- Maintained all existing employee management functionality

### 3. Direct Cognito Data Access

- Uses getCurrentUser() directly within the PersonalInfoTab component
- Formats Cognito attribute data consistently, handling both standard and custom attributes
- Handles various naming formats (given_name/family_name vs firstName/lastName)
- Provides appropriate defaults for missing data

### 4. Comprehensive UI States

- Added proper loading indicator during data retrieval
- Implemented error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Added empty state handling for when no data is available
- Ensured all states have appropriate visual styling

## Testing

After running the fix script:

1. Navigate to the Employee Management section, which will now default to the Personal Information tab
2. The tab should display user data directly from Cognito attributes, even if API calls fail
3. Check the browser console to verify the data loading process is properly logged
4. Click the "Employee Management" tab to verify that employee management functionality still works

## Additional Notes

This approach differs from previous fixes by:
- Completely bypassing the API dependency for personal information display
- Creating a dedicated, isolated component that focuses solely on displaying user data
- Using a tab-based architecture to clearly separate concerns
- Implementing proper loading states and error handling
