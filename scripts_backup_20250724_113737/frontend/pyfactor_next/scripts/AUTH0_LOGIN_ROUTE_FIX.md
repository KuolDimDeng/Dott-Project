# Auth0 Login Route Fix

## Problem
The Auth0 login route (api/auth/login) was returning a 500 error due to:
1. Variable scope issues in the error handling block
2. Domain consistency issues between Auth0 configuration and the login route
3. Improper error handling when environmental variables are not available

## Solution
This script fixes the issues by:
1. Properly scoping variables to ensure they're available in the catch block
2. Ensuring consistent domain usage with the Auth0 custom domain (auth.dottapps.com)
3. Improving error handling to provide better diagnostic information
4. Adding additional validation to prevent errors during initialization

## Technical Details
The script modifies the login route handler to:
- Move variable declarations to the top of the try block
- Improve error handling with proper scoping
- Ensure consistent domain usage between Auth0 config and the login route
- Add better validation for environment variables
