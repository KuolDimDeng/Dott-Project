# AppCache Syntax Errors Fix

## Issue
The previous deployment failed with syntax errors in the appCache utility usage:

```
Error: The left-hand side of an assignment expression must be a variable or a property access.
appCache.getAll() = appCache.getAll() || {};
            ^
Invalid assignment target
```

## Files Fixed
The following files had syntax errors that were fixed:

1. **SignInForm.js**:
   - Replaced `appCache.getAll() = appCache.getAll() || {}` with proper initialization
   - Used `appCache.set()` method instead of direct assignment

2. **DashboardClient.js**:
   - Fixed invalid assignments to function calls
   - Replaced `appCache.get('tenant.id') = result.tenantId` with `appCache.set('tenant.id', result.tenantId)`

3. **DashAppBar.js**:
   - Fixed invalid assignment to appCache.getAll()
   - Used proper initialization with if statement and set() method

4. **EmployeeManagement.js**:
   - Fixed invalid assignments similar to other files
   - Used set() method for setting auth token

5. **OnboardingStateManager.js**:
   - Fixed syntax error in tenant ID retrieval code
   - Fixed duplicate lines that were causing parsing issues

## Root Cause
The appCache utility was designed to use `set()` methods for modifying values, but the code was
using direct assignment to function return values which is invalid JavaScript syntax.

## Fix Approach
1. Used proper conditional initialization of the app cache
2. Replaced function call assignments with proper set() method calls
3. Added proper null/undefined checks

These changes preserve the same functionality while using valid JavaScript syntax.
