# Amplify Import Syntax Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve syntax errors in components that were using Amplify imports, which were causing build failures after migrating to Auth0.

## Issues Fixed

1. **SignInForm.js**:
   - Fixed destructured imports that were causing syntax errors
   - Replaced duplicate code blocks
   - Added Auth0 helper functions to replace Amplify functionality

2. **DashboardClient.js**:
   - Fixed missing imports and incomplete await statements
   - Replaced Amplify import references with Auth0 adapter imports

3. **DashboardLoader.js**:
   - Removed duplicate 'use client' directive
   - Fixed Amplify imports with Auth0 adapter

4. **Added auth0Adapter.js**:
   - Created a comprehensive adapter utility to provide Amplify-compatible functions using Auth0
   - Implemented functions like fetchUserAttributes, fetchAuthSession, updateUserAttributes, etc.
   - Added tenant ID storage and management functionality

## Implementation Details

### Auth0 Adapter
The core of the fix is a new Auth0 adapter utility that provides Amplify-compatible functions using Auth0 functionality. This serves as a drop-in replacement for AWS Amplify functions that were used before migrating to Auth0.

The adapter maps Auth0 user metadata to the expected Cognito custom attributes format:
- Auth0: `user['https://dottapps.com/tenant_id']`
- Cognito: `custom:tenant_ID`

### Components Updated
- **SignInForm.js**: Now properly uses useState hooks and Auth0 context
- **DashboardClient.js**: Updated to import from the Auth0 adapter
- **DashboardLoader.js**: Fixed duplicate directives and imports

## Migration Path

This implementation provides a smooth transition path from AWS Cognito to Auth0 by:
1. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing code patterns
2. Adapting Auth0 user metadata to match the Cognito attribute format
3. Providing equivalent functionality for critical Amplify functions

## Next Steps

Now that the syntax errors are fixed, the following improvements could be considered:
1. Fully adopt Auth0 patterns and standards rather than maintaining Cognito compatibility
2. Update components to directly use Auth0 React hooks instead of adapter functions
3. Migrate remaining Amplify references throughout the codebase

## Deployment

These fixes have been deployed to production, and the build process should now complete successfully without syntax errors.
