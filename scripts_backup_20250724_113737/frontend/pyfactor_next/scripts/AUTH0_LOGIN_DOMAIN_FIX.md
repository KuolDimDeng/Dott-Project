# Auth0 Login Domain Configuration Fix

## Problem

The Auth0 login endpoint at `/api/auth/login` was returning a 500 Internal Server Error. This was happening because:

1. The Auth0 domain configuration had potential format issues
2. The middleware was not properly handling the login route 
3. Error handling was insufficient to diagnose the specific problem

## Solution

This fix implements several improvements:

1. **Enhanced Domain Handling**: The Auth0 domain is now properly validated and formatted before use, ensuring it doesn't have protocol prefixes or trailing slashes that could cause issues.

2. **Improved Middleware Configuration**: The middleware now explicitly forces browser navigation for the login route and includes diagnostic headers for troubleshooting.

3. **Better Error Handling**: The login route now includes more detailed validation and error messages to make diagnosing issues easier.

4. **Environment Variable Validation**: The script checks and fixes environment variables to ensure they're correctly formatted.

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/auth/login/route.js`: Updated with improved error handling and domain validation
2. `src/middleware.js`: Enhanced to properly handle Auth0 login route
3. `.env.local`: Checked and updated to ensure correct Auth0 domain format
4. `src/config/auth0.js`: Updated to handle domain format issues

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. Visit `https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login`
2. You should be redirected to the Auth0 login page
3. After login, you should be redirected back to the application

If you still see an error, check the following:

1. Auth0 tenant configuration in the Auth0 dashboard
2. Client ID and domain settings in environment variables
3. Application server logs for detailed error messages
