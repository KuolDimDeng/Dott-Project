# Cognito Authentication Session Fix

## Issue
Users were experiencing authentication issues such as:
- "UserAlreadyAuthenticatedException" when trying to sign in
- HTTP 400 errors when communicating with Cognito after signing out
- Session state inconsistencies

## Root Causes
1. Incomplete cleanup during sign out
2. Race conditions in authentication state management
3. Amplify configuration issues during sign in/out cycles
4. Missing Amplify reconfiguration before sign-in attempts

## Solution
The fix implements several improvements:

1. Enhanced `clearAllAuthData()` function:
   - Forces Amplify reconfiguration before sign-out
   - Adds more thorough cleanup of cached authentication data
   - Includes waiting periods to ensure operations complete

2. Added `refreshAuthenticationState()` function:
   - Provides a "nuclear option" to completely reset the authentication state
   - Useful for recovering from severe authentication state corruption

3. Added `prepareForSignIn()` function:
   - Checks if a user is already signed in and signs them out first
   - Ensures Amplify is properly configured before sign-in
   - Prevents "UserAlreadyAuthenticatedException" errors

4. Enhanced `safeSignOut()` function:
   - Always forces Amplify reconfiguration before signing out
   - Clears cached user state before the sign-out operation
   - Adds waiting periods to ensure operations complete

5. Enhanced `ensureConfigAndCall()` function:
   - Checks if user is already authenticated before sign-in
   - Attempts sign-out first if user is already authenticated

6. Updated SignInForm component:
   - Calls `prepareForSignIn()` before authentication attempts
   - Ensures clean state before starting sign-in process

## Verification Steps
1. Sign in to the application
2. Sign out of the application
3. Sign in again - this should work without errors
4. Check browser console for any authentication related errors

## Rollback
If issues persist, the original files can be restored from the backups created during script execution.
Backup files are located in `frontend/pyfactor_next/backups/` with timestamped filenames.

## Version History
- v1.0 (Initial implementation)
