# Auth0 Login Rewrite Error Fix

## Issue Summary
Users were experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when accessing the login endpoint at https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login with the error:
```
[Error: NextResponse.rewrite() was used in a app route handler, this is not currently supported. Please remove the invocation to continue.]
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The login route was setting the 'x-middleware-rewrite' header, which is internally interpreted by Next.js as a rewrite operation.
2. Rewrite operations are not supported in App Router API routes (server components), only in middleware.

## Solution Implemented
1. Removed the problematic 'x-middleware-rewrite' header from the login route's response.
2. Maintained the redirect functionality with proper cache headers.

## Code Changes
### In `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/auth/login/route.js`:
- Removed the `response.headers.set('x-middleware-rewrite', request.url);` line
- Kept other functionality and error handling intact

## Testing and Verification
The fix was tested by:
1. Verifying successful login redirects without the 500 error
2. Ensuring proper handling of the Auth0 authorization flow

## Deployment
The fix is deployed to production via the Vercel deployment pipeline.

## Monitoring
Continue to monitor application logs for any Auth0-related errors. The enhanced logging will provide more detailed information about any issues that might occur.
