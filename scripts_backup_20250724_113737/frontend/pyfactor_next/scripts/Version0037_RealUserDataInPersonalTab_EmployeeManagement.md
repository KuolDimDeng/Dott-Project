# Personal Information Tab Real User Data Implementation

## Overview

The Personal Information tab in the Employee Management component was previously using mock data. This change replaces the mock data with real user information from multiple sources:

1. User Profile API (`/api/user/profile`)
2. AWS App Cache (`window.__APP_CACHE`)
3. Cognito attributes (via `fetchUserAttributes()`)

## Implementation Details

### Version: 1.0
### Date: 2025-04-26
### Issue Reference: UI-2104

## Changes Made

- Modified the `fetchPersonalInfo` function in `PersonalInformationTab` component to retrieve real user data 
- Implemented a fallback mechanism to try multiple data sources in order of priority
- Maintains backward compatibility by keeping the existing data structure
- No UI changes - only the source of data has changed

## Data Sources (in order of priority)

1. **User Profile API**: First attempts to fetch data from `/api/user/profile`, which returns Cognito attributes and database information
2. **AWS App Cache**: If API fails, tries to get user data from window.__APP_CACHE.userProfile
3. **Cognito Attributes**: If both API and cache fail, tries to get attributes directly from Cognito
4. **Default Values**: If all sources fail, uses empty defaults

## Field Mapping

The following fields are now populated with real user data:

| PersonalInfo Field | Source Fields |
|--------------------|---------------|
| first_name | profile.firstName, profile.first_name |
| last_name | profile.lastName, profile.last_name |
| email | profile.email |
| phone_number | profile.phoneNumber, profile.phone_number |
| address | profile.street, profile.address |
| city | profile.city |
| state | profile.state |
| zip_code | profile.postcode, profile.zip_code |
| country | profile.country (defaults to 'US') |

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data is stored in cookies or localStorage
- Uses AWS App Cache for in-memory storage
- Tenant isolation maintained by including tenant ID in API requests
- No hardcoded tenant IDs or security keys

## Testing

1. Sign in with a user that has profile information
2. Navigate to the Personal Information tab
3. Verify that the tab shows real user information
4. Test with both admin and non-admin users

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered, roll back by running:

```
cd /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/scripts/backups
# Find the latest backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -t EmployeeManagement.js.backup-* | head -1)
# Restore the backup
cp $LATEST_BACKUP /Users/kuoldeng/projectx/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/components/forms/EmployeeManagement.js
