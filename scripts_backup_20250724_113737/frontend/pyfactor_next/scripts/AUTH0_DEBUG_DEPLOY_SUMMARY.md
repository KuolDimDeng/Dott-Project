# Auth0 Enhanced Debug Logging Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status

âœ… **SUCCESS**: The enhanced debug logging has been successfully deployed.

## Deployment Date

2025-06-07

## Files Modified

1. `src/config/auth0.js` - Enhanced with detailed domain and environment variable logging
2. `src/app/api/auth/login/route.js` - Added comprehensive request/response and error logging
3. `src/app/api/auth/session/route.js` - Added session retrieval and validation logging

## Expected Outcomes

1. The enhanced logging will produce detailed information about:
   - Auth0 domain configuration and formatting
   - Login request parameters and headers
   - Token validation and processing
   - Session management and error handling

2. These logs will help identify why the 500 Internal Server Error is occurring at:
   `https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login`

3. Specifically, we will determine if the Auth0 custom domain configuration (`auth.dottapps.com`) is the root cause

## Monitoring Instructions

1. Monitor the Vercel deployment logs for errors during build and deployment
2. After deployment, test the login functionality and check server logs for the detailed debug output
3. Focus on logs with "domain" mentions to verify if the custom domain is correctly configured

## Next Steps

1. Analyze the collected logs to identify the specific cause of the 500 error
2. Prepare a targeted fix based on the diagnostic information
3. Verify the fix works in both development and production environments

## Issues to Look For

1. Domain mismatch between `auth.dottapps.com` and any hardcoded values
2. JWE token validation failures due to incorrect secret or domain configuration
3. Auth0 API rate limiting issues causing cascading authentication failures
4. RSC payload fetch failures due to improper routing or middleware

If the deployment itself fails, check the Vercel build logs for any syntax errors or build failures.
