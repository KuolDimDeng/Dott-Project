# Employee Detail and Edit Window Fix

## Issue Description
When a user clicks on the edit button for an employee in the list, the detail window appears behind the edit window, causing a confusing user experience.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by two problems:
1. The employee details dialog has a z-index of 55 (`z-[55]`), while the edit form has a z-index of 60 (`z-[60]`)
2. The detail window wasn't being properly closed before the edit window opens, causing both to be visible simultaneously

## Fix Implementation
The fix modifies the `EmployeeManagement.js` file to ensure that:
1. The `handleEditEmployee` function properly closes the detail window before opening the edit window
2. When clicking the "Edit Employee" button in the details dialog, a small delay is added to ensure the detail window is fully closed before opening the edit form
