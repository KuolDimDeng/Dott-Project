# Version0013 Fix: DashAppBar User Initials Display

## Summary
This script fixes the issue with missing user initials in the DashAppBar. While the previous fix (Version0012) successfully addressed the business name display, the user initials were still missing from the avatar.

## Version
1.0.0 (2025-05-15)

## Files Created
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/public/scripts/Version0013_fix_DashAppBar_user_initials_display.js` - Client-side fix script

## Issues Fixed
1. **Missing User Initials**: Fixed avatar elements not displaying user initials despite having the correct data
2. **CSS Selector Issues**: Implemented more comprehensive selectors to target all possible avatar containers
3. **Attribute Extraction**: Improved extraction of first name and last name from Cognito attributes
4. **DOM Update Timing**: Added more robust retry and mutation observer logic

## Implementation Details
1. **Comprehensive Avatar Selection**:
   - Added multiple CSS selectors to target all possible avatar containers
   - Included fallback for different avatar styles and configurations

2. **Improved Attribute Handling**:
   - Enhanced user initials generation from Cognito attributes
   - Added robust fallbacks for different attribute naming patterns
   - Properly trim attribute values to handle space issues

3. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - Updated display properties to ensure proper CSS styling
   - Added capability to create avatar elements if needed
   - Improved mutation observer to detect relevant DOM changes

4. **Retry Logic**:
   - Increased retry attempts and improved timing
   - Better error handling and status reporting

## Execution

## Installation
To apply this fix:

## Testing
