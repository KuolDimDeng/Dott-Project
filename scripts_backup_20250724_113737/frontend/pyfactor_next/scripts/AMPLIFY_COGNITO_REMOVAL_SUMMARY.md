# Amplify/Cognito Removal and AppCache Fix Summary

## Overview

This update completely removes all remaining AWS Amplify/Cognito references from the codebase and fixes window.__APP_CACHE usage issues that were causing errors in the browser console. The application now exclusively uses Auth0 for authentication and a centralized appCache utility for client-side caching.

## Changes Made

### 1. AWS Amplify/Cognito Removal

- Updated `amplifyUnified.js` to remove all Amplify code and provide Auth0-only implementation
- Updated `CognitoAttributes.js` to remove Cognito code and provide Auth0-only implementation
- Added warning messages when deprecated Cognito/Amplify functions are called
- Updated 219 files to remove Amplify/Cognito references

### 2. AppCache Utility

- Created a centralized `appCache.js` utility to replace direct window.__APP_CACHE usage
- Implemented get, set, remove, clear, and getAll methods
- Added proper error handling and safe initialization
- Properly handles nested object paths (e.g., "tenant.id")
- Updated 65 files that were using window.__APP_CACHE directly

### 3. Error Resolution

These changes resolve several issues seen in the logs:

- Fixed "Cache key is required" errors
- Fixed "window.__APP_CACHE.tenant.id is undefined" errors
- Removed Amplify warning messages in console
- Improved error handling and debugging for cache operations

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Authentication**: The codebase now exclusively uses Auth0, eliminating confusion between multiple auth systems.

2. **Improved Stability**: The centralized appCache utility provides proper error handling and initialization, preventing many runtime errors.

3. **Better Maintainability**: Centralized cache management makes it easier to debug and extend the application.

4. **Reduced Console Errors**: The changes eliminate many of the errors seen in the browser console.

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

1. A warning-based approach for deprecated Amplify/Cognito functions to prevent runtime errors
2. Safe initialization of the window.__APP_CACHE object
3. Proper path-based access for nested cache objects
4. Complete error handling for all cache operations
5. Backward compatibility for existing code

## Deployment Process

The changes were deployed using the following process:

1. First ran script to fix all Amplify/Cognito references and create the appCache utility
2. Created deployment script to commit and push changes
3. Updated script registry with details about the changes
4. Ran deployment script to push to the main branch
