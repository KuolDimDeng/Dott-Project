# Tenant-Based User Isolation Feature

## Overview

The tenant-based user isolation feature ensures that business owners can only see and manage users within their own tenant (business), not users from other tenants. This is critical for multi-tenant applications where data privacy and security between different businesses are paramount.

## Problem

Without proper isolation, all users in the application could potentially be visible to any owner account, creating several issues:

1. **Privacy concerns**: Business owners could see users from unrelated businesses
2. **Security risks**: Potential for unauthorized access or modification of users from other tenants
3. **Poor user experience**: Cluttered user management screens with irrelevant users
4. **Scalability problems**: As the application grows to thousands of businesses, the user lists would become unmanageable

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive tenant isolation solution using several components:

### 1. Tenant ID Attribute

All users now have a `custom:tenantId` attribute in Cognito that associates them with a specific tenant (business). This attribute:
- Is added to all new users during invitation
- Is added to existing users via a migration script
- Serves as the primary mechanism for filtering users by tenant

### 2. API Filtering

The user listing API (`/api/users/list`) has been modified to:
- Extract the tenant ID from the requesting user's session or context
- Filter users to only include those with a matching tenant ID
- Handle edge cases and backward compatibility for users without tenant IDs

### 3. User Invitation Process

The user invitation process (`/api/users/invite`) has been updated to:
- Automatically assign the tenant ID of the inviting user to newly invited users
- Ensure all new users are properly associated with their business tenant
- Maintain consistent tenant IDs across the application

## Implementation Details

### User Listing API (`/api/users/list/route.js`)

The user listing endpoint now:
1. Extracts the tenant ID from the request context
2. Adds a filter for `custom:tenantId` to the Cognito ListUsers command
3. Performs an additional client-side filter for backward compatibility
4. Returns only users that match the tenant ID of the requesting user

### User Invitation API (`/api/users/invite/route.js`)

The user invitation endpoint now:
1. Extracts the tenant ID from the request context
2. Adds the tenant ID as a custom attribute when creating a new user
3. Returns the tenant ID in the response for confirmation

### Migration Script (`Version0013_add_tenant_id_to_users.js`)

A migration script was created to add tenant IDs to existing users:
1. Lists all users from Cognito
2. Groups users by business name or email domain
3. Assigns a consistent tenant ID to each group
4. Updates user attributes in Cognito
5. Generates a report of all changes

## Usage

### For Developers

To maintain proper tenant isolation:
1. Always include tenant ID filtering in any user-related API endpoints
2. Pass tenant ID in user creation/invitation flows
3. Verify tenant ID matches when accessing or modifying user data

### For Admins

To manage tenant isolation:
1. Run the migration script to assign tenant IDs to existing users
2. Review the generated reports to verify user grouping
3. Use the AWS Cognito console to manually adjust tenant IDs if needed

## Testing

To verify tenant isolation:
1. Create test accounts for multiple tenants
2. Log in as an owner from Tenant A
3. Verify only users from Tenant A are visible in the user management page
4. Add a new user to Tenant A and confirm they appear in the list
5. Log in as an owner from Tenant B
6. Verify only users from Tenant B are visible (and not users from Tenant A)

## Benefits

- **Improved security**: Each business can only access their own users
- **Enhanced privacy**: User data is properly isolated between tenants
- **Better performance**: Smaller, filtered result sets improve page load times
- **Scalability**: The application can support thousands of businesses with proper isolation
- **Compliance**: Helps meet data privacy regulations by enforcing proper access controls

## Future Enhancements

- Add tenant ID validation middleware for all user-related API endpoints
- Implement admin-only tools to manage tenant assignments
- Add tenant metrics and reporting features
