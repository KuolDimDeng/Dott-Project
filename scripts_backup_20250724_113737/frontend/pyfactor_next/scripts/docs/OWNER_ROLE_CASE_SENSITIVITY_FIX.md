# Owner Role Case Sensitivity Fix

## Issue Description

Users with the role "owner" (lowercase) could not add users in the Settings Management page, despite having the correct owner role. The issue was due to a case-sensitive comparison in the `isOwner` function in SettingsManagement.js, which was checking for exactly `'owner'` (lowercase) while some users might have `'Owner'` (uppercase) or other case variations in their attribute.

## Fix Implementation

The fix (Version0010_fix_owner_role_check_in_settings.js) modifies the `isOwner` function in SettingsManagement.js to use a case-insensitive comparison when checking the user role:

```javascript
// Before
const isOwner = useCallback(() => {
  if (!user || !user.attributes) return false;
  return user.attributes['custom:userrole'] === 'owner';
}, [user]);

// After
const isOwner = useCallback(() => {
  if (!user || !user.attributes) return false;
  // Use case-insensitive comparison for the role
  return user.attributes['custom:userrole']?.toLowerCase() === 'owner';
}, [user]);
```

This ensures that users with the role "owner" in any case variation (e.g., "owner", "Owner", "OWNER") can add users in the Settings Management page.

## How to Test

1. Log in as a user with the role "owner" (lowercase)
2. Navigate to the Settings Management page
3. Try to add a new user
4. Verify that you no longer receive the error message "Only owners can add users"

This fix complements the earlier case sensitivity fix implemented in `Version0002_fix_user_role_case_sensitivity.js`, which addressed the issue in the context of menu visibility. The current fix addresses the issue specifically in the user management functionality.
