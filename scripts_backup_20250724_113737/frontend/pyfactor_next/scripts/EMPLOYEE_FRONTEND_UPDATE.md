# Employee Frontend Update Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the frontend changes made to support the new fields added to the Employee model:
- `ID_verified`: Boolean field indicating if an employee's ID has been verified
- `areManager`: Boolean field indicating if an employee is a manager
- `supervising`: Array field containing the IDs of employees being supervised

## Changes Made

### 1. Employee Serializer Update

The employee serializer in the backend has been updated to include the new fields:
- Added `ID_verified`, `areManager`, and `supervising` to the fields list
- Ensured proper serialization of the new fields

### 2. Employee Form Component

The employee form component has been updated to include UI elements for the new fields:
- Added a checkbox for `ID_verified` status
- Added a checkbox for `areManager` status
- Added a multi-select dropdown for `supervising` employees

### 3. API Client

The API client has been updated to handle the new fields:
- Added comments documenting the new fields
- Ensured proper handling of the new fields in API requests and responses

## Implementation Details

### Employee Form Component

The employee form now includes the following new sections:

```jsx
{/* ID Verification Status */}
<div className="mb-4">
  <label className="block text-gray-700 text-sm font-bold mb-2" htmlFor="ID_verified">
    ID Verified
  </label>
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    id="ID_verified"
    name="ID_verified"
    checked={formData.ID_verified || false}
    onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('ID_verified', e.target.checked)}
    className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-600 focus:ring-blue-500 border-gray-300 rounded"
  />
  <span className="ml-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Employee ID has been verified</span>
</div>

{/* Manager Status */}
<div className="mb-4">
  <label className="block text-gray-700 text-sm font-bold mb-2" htmlFor="areManager">
    Manager Status
  </label>
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    id="areManager"
    name="areManager"
    checked={formData.areManager || false}
    onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('areManager', e.target.checked)}
    className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-600 focus:ring-blue-500 border-gray-300 rounded"
  />
  <span className="ml-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Employee is a manager</span>
</div>

{/* Supervising Employees */}
<div className="mb-4">
  <label className="block text-gray-700 text-sm font-bold mb-2" htmlFor="supervising">
    Supervising Employees
  </label>
  <select
    id="supervising"
    name="supervising"
    multiple
    value={formData.supervising || []}
    onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('supervising', Array.from(e.target.selectedOptions, option => option.value))}
    className="shadow appearance-none border rounded w-full py-2 px-3 text-gray-700 leading-tight focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline"
  >
    {/* This would be populated with available employees */}
    <option value="">Select employees to supervise</option>
  </select>
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1">Hold Ctrl/Cmd to select multiple employees</p>
</div>
```

### API Client

The API client has been updated with the following comments:

```javascript
// New fields added for employee management
// ID_verified: Boolean indicating if employee ID has been verified
// areManager: Boolean indicating if employee is a manager
// supervising: Array of employee IDs being supervised by this employee
```

## Execution Instructions

1. Run the update script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/Version0001_update_employee_serializer_for_new_fields.js
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Create backups of the files being modified
   - Update the employee serializer
   - Update the employee form component
   - Update the API client
   - Update the script registry

3. Verify the changes:
   - Check that the employee form displays the new fields correctly
   - Test creating and updating employees with the new fields
   - Ensure the API client correctly handles the new fields

## Rollback Procedure

If you need to rollback the changes:

1. Locate the backup files created by the script (they will have a `.backup-{timestamp}` extension)
2. Restore the original files from the backups
3. Run any necessary database migrations to revert the database changes

## Dependencies

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Notes

- The supervising employees dropdown will need to be populated with available employees from the backend
- Consider adding validation to ensure that an employee cannot be assigned to supervise themselves
- The UI may need further customization to match your application's design system
