# Static Images Verification

## Overview
This document outlines the verification process for static images in the Dott application, focusing on ensuring all images are properly included in the production deployment.

## Image Verification Process

1. All static images have been verified to exist locally in the repository.
2. Images are being properly committed to the git repository to ensure they are included in deployments.
3. The Vercel deployment configuration has been checked to ensure static assets in the public directory are included.
4. A verification script (Version0146_verify_static_images_deployment.mjs) has been created to validate and ensure proper deployment.

## Critical Images Verified

The following images have been verified to exist in the project:

| Image Name | Local Path | Size |
|------------|------------|------|
| PyfactorLandingpage.png | frontend/pyfactor_next/public/static/images/PyfactorLandingpage.png | 7769 bytes |
| PyfactorDashboard.png | frontend/pyfactor_next/public/static/images/PyfactorDashboard.png | (verified) |
| Work-Life-Balance-1--Streamline-Brooklyn.png | frontend/pyfactor_next/public/static/images/Work-Life-Balance-1--Streamline-Brooklyn.png | (verified) |

## Production URLs

These images should be accessible at the following production URLs:

1. Landing Page Logo:
   - URL: https://dottapps.com/static/images/PyfactorLandingpage.png

2. Dashboard Logo:
   - URL: https://dottapps.com/static/images/PyfactorDashboard.png

3. Work-Life Balance Image:
   - URL: https://dottapps.com/static/images/Work-Life-Balance-1--Streamline-Brooklyn.png

## Verification Steps

To verify the images are properly deployed in production:

1. Open each URL in a browser
2. If the image loads correctly, it is properly deployed
3. If any image fails to load, check the Vercel build logs and deployment configuration

## Auth0 Domain Configuration

The Auth0 domain is configured as `auth.dottapps.com` in the environment variables. This is correctly set as a custom domain for Auth0, but we need to ensure the correct configuration in Auth0 settings.

The 500 Internal Server Error when accessing https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login can be related to either:
1. Configuration issues with the Auth0 custom domain
2. Server-side errors in the login route handler

## Current Status

All images are available locally in the repository and are being included in the git commits. The deployment process will include these files in the production build.

The verification script has been created to:
1. Verify all images exist locally
2. Add images to git if needed
3. Generate production URLs for verification
4. Update the script registry to track this verification

## Next Steps

1. Complete the deployment to ensure all images are available in production
2. Verify the images using the production URLs
3. Fix any Auth0 domain configuration issues if identified during the deployment
