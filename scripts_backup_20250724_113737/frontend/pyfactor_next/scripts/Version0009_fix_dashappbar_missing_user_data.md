# DashAppBar Missing User Data Fix

## Overview

This script fixes issues with missing business name and user initials in the DashAppBar component after authentication.

## Implementation Details

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-04-30  
**File:** `/scripts/Version0009_fix_dashappbar_missing_user_data.js`

### Problem Description

After signing in, the DashAppBar component fails to display:
1. The business name in the app bar header
2. The user's initials in the avatar component

This occurs due to issues with:
- Cognito attribute retrieval problems
- Race conditions in the component lifecycle
- DOM re-rendering causing data loss
- Improper data flow between contexts and components

### Solution

The script implements the following fixes:

1. **Reliable Cognito Attribute Retrieval**: Uses multiple methods to ensure user attributes are properly fetched from Cognito.
2. **User Initials Generation**: Implements a robust function to generate user initials from name or email.
3. **Business Name Extraction**: Properly extracts business name from various possible Cognito attribute formats.
4. **DOM Updating**: Directly updates the DOM elements with the correct user data.
5. **Mutation Observer**: Implements a mutation observer to detect when the DashAppBar re-renders.
6. **APP_CACHE Integration**: Stores retrieved data in APP_CACHE for persistence across renders.
7. **Retry Mechanism**: Implements a retry system for fetching data if initial attempts fail.

### Key Functions

- `getCognitoUserAttributes()`: Fetches user attributes from Cognito using multiple fallback methods
- `generateUserInitials()`: Generates user initials from name or email attributes
- `getBusinessName()`: Extracts business name from Cognito attributes
- `updateUserInitials()`: Updates the user initials in the DOM
- `updateBusinessName()`: Updates the business name in the DOM
- `setupObserver()`: Sets up a mutation observer to handle DOM changes
- `applyFix()`: Main function to apply all fixes

### Technical Implementation

The script uses the following techniques:
- DOM manipulation to update user interface elements
- MutationObserver API to detect DOM changes
- Async/await for Cognito API calls
- APP_CACHE for data persistence
- Retry mechanism with increasing intervals

## Usage

The script automatically loads and applies the fixes when the page loads. No manual intervention is required.

## Dependencies

- Requires access to Cognito user attributes
- Requires window.__APP_CACHE to be accessible
- Works with modern browsers supporting MutationObserver
