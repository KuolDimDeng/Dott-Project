# Auth0 Login 500 Error Fix

## Issue Summary
Users were experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when accessing the login endpoint at https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login. The error occurred due to a mismatch between the configured Auth0 domain in the environment variables (auth.dottapps.com) and the implementation in the login route handler.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The login route was not properly handling the Auth0 custom domain configuration.
2. The error handling in the login route was insufficient, resulting in unhandled exceptions that cascaded to 500 errors.
3. The auth.dottapps.com custom domain was not being properly utilized in the login route's redirection logic.

## Solution Implemented
1. Enhanced the login route handler to properly handle the Auth0 custom domain configuration.
2. Improved error handling to prevent unhandled exceptions.
3. Added fallback domain handling to ensure compatibility with both tenant and custom domains.
4. Implemented detailed logging to help troubleshoot any future issues.

## Code Changes
### In `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/auth/login/route.js`:
- Added proper error handling around Auth0 client initialization
- Ensured domain configuration is consistent with environment variables
- Implemented fallback mechanism for domain resolution
- Added detailed logging for easier debugging

### In `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/api/auth/[...auth0]/route.js`:
- Verified compatibility with the custom domain configuration
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases

## Testing and Verification
The fix was tested by:
1. Verifying successful login redirects with the custom domain
2. Ensuring proper handling of error cases
3. Confirming the login endpoint returns proper status codes in all scenarios

## Deployment
The fix is deployed to production via the Vercel deployment pipeline.

## Monitoring
Continue to monitor application logs for any Auth0-related errors. The enhanced logging will provide more detailed information about any issues that might occur.
