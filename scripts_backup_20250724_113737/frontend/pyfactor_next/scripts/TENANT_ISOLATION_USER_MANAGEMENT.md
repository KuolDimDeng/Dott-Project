# Tenant Isolation for User Management

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of tenant isolation in the User Management page. Tenant isolation is critical for multi-tenant SaaS applications to ensure that data from one tenant (organization) is not exposed to other tenants.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Filtering Users by Tenant ID

The user list in the User Management page now filters users based on the tenant ID of the signed-in user. This ensures that users can only see other users from their own organization.

The `fetchEmployees` function in `SettingsManagement.js` now:
- Gets the tenant ID (`custom:tenant_ID`) from the current signed-in user
- Passes this context to the `userService.getTenantUsers()` function
- The API then filters users by this tenant ID

### 2. Adding Tenant ID to New Users

When an owner creates a new user, their tenant ID is now automatically passed to the new user. This ensures that new users are correctly associated with the owner's organization.

The `handleAddUser` function in `SettingsManagement.js` now:
- Gets the tenant ID from the current user (owner)
- Passes this tenant ID when creating the new user
- Includes all necessary custom attributes

### 3. Handling Custom Attributes

The system now handles all Cognito custom attributes when creating new users, ensuring attributes like:

```
custom:dateformat
custom:datefounded
custom:employeeid
custom:language
custom:lastlogin
custom:legalstructure
custom:onboarding
custom:paymentid
custom:paymentmethod
custom:payverified
custom:preferences
custom:requirespayment
custom:setupdone
custom:subplan
custom:subscriptioninterval
custom:subscriptionstatus
custom:tenant_ID
custom:acctstatus
custom:attrversion
custom:businesscountry
custom:businessid
custom:businessname
custom:businessstate
custom:businesssubtypes
custom:businesstype
custom:currency
```

are properly passed from the owner to new users.

## Components Updated

1. **SettingsManagement.js**:
   - Updated `fetchEmployees()` to filter by tenant ID
   - Updated `handleAddUser()` to pass tenant ID and custom attributes

2. **userService.js**:
   - Enhanced `inviteUser()` to handle tenant ID and custom attributes
   - Added support for passing all Cognito attributes to new users

3. **API Routes**:
   - Updated `/api/users/invite` endpoint to handle custom attributes
   - Ensured proper tenant ID attribute name (`custom:tenant_ID`) is used

## Security Benefits

This implementation provides several security benefits:

1. **Data Isolation**: Each tenant can only see users from their own organization
2. **User Access Control**: New users automatically inherit the tenant ID of their creator
3. **Attribute Preservation**: All necessary Cognito attributes are passed to new users

## Testing

To test this implementation:

1. Log in as an owner user
2. Navigate to Settings > User Management
3. Verify the user list only shows users from your organization
4. Create a new user and verify they inherit your tenant ID
5. Log in as the new user and verify they can only see users from the same tenant

## Code Changes

The changes were implemented across these four scripts:

1. `Version0038_implement_tenant_isolation_for_user_management.js`
2. `Version0039_update_userService_inviteUser_for_tenant_isolation.js`
3. `Version0040_update_users_invite_api_for_custom_attributes.js`
4. `Version0041_fix_tenant_id_casing_in_users_list_api.js`

The last script ensures consistent naming of the tenant ID attribute (`custom:tenant_ID`) in the API, which is critical for proper tenant isolation.
