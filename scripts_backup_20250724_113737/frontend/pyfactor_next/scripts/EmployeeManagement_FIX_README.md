# EmployeeManagement Component Bug Fixes

## Issue Description

The EmployeeManagement component was experiencing two major issues:

1. **React Key Spread Error**: 
   - React was generating console errors due to keys being spread within props objects in JSX elements
   - The error message indicated: "React keys must be passed directly to JSX without using spread"
   - This affected `<th>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` elements in the data table

2. **Personal Information Tab Not Showing User Data**:
   - The personal information tab was blank even though employees were successfully loaded
   - User profile data from the API was not being displayed correctly
   - Network requests to `/api/user/profile` were resulting in 401 Unauthorized errors

## Fix Implementation

The fix script (Version0001_FixPersonalInfoAndReactKeySpread_EmployeeManagement.js) addresses both issues:

### 1. React Key Spread Fix

The table rendering was modified to prevent spreading key props:

- Modified `getTableProps()` usage to avoid extracting and spreading keys
- Applied the same fix to header groups, rows, and cells
- Provided explicit key values for rows and cells using a combination of IDs

### 2. Personal Information Data Retrieval Fix

Enhanced the `fetchCurrentUser` function to:

- Add detailed debug logging
- Properly retrieve the tenant ID from URL or app cache
- Pass the tenant ID to the `getUserProfile` function for proper authentication
- Add additional logging to track the owner status check

## Testing

After running the fix script:

1. Check the browser console to verify no more React key spread errors
2. Navigate to the Employee Management section and confirm the personal information is displayed
3. Check the network tab to verify API calls to `/api/user/profile` are successful

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider adding error boundaries to catch and recover from API request failures
2. Implement a retry mechanism for failed authentication requests
3. Add more detailed error messages to help with debugging authentication issues
4. Consider implementing a fallback UI for when user information can't be loaded
