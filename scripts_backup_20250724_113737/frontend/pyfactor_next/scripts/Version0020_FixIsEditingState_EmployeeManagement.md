# Fix for setIsEditing Not Defined Error

## Overview
This script adds the missing `isEditing` state variable to the Employee Management component to fix the `setIsEditing is not defined` error that occurs when attempting to edit an employee.

## Issue Description
When clicking the edit button for an employee, the application throws the following error:
```
Error: setIsEditing is not defined
src/app/dashboard/components/forms/EmployeeManagement.js (1912:5) @ handleEditEmployee
```

This occurs because the `handleEditEmployee` function tries to use `setIsEditing(true)` to enable edit mode, but the corresponding state variable and setter function were never defined.

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/components/forms/EmployeeManagement.js`

### Changes Made
1. Added the missing state variable declaration:
   ```javascript
   const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
   ```

2. Placed it in the appropriate location within the state declarations section of the component

3. Created a backup of the original file before making changes

## Technical Notes
- The script identifies the state declarations section in the component and adds the new state variable there
- If the state declarations section cannot be found, it falls back to adding the state variable after any existing state variable
- The implementation maintains the existing component structure and behavior

## Version History
- v1.0 (2025-04-25): Initial implementation

## Testing Notes
After implementing this fix, verify:
1. The edit functionality works correctly when clicking the edit button for an employee
2. The edit form displays properly
3. Changes can be saved successfully
4. The component returns to the list view after saving changes
