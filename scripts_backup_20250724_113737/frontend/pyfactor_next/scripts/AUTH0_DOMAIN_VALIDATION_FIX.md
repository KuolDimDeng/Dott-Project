# Auth0 Domain Validation Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error at the `/api/auth/login` endpoint due to inconsistent Auth0 domain validation across different parts of the authentication flow:

1. `auth0.js` was only checking `process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN` but using `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN` in the actual config
2. `login/route.js` had strict validation that would return 500 errors if the domain wasn't properly formatted
3. `[...auth0]/route.js` had yet another approach to domain validation

## Solution

Version0156 implements a comprehensive fix by:

1. Making all auth-related files check both `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN` consistently
2. Replacing error-throwing validation with graceful fallbacks to the custom domain
3. Improving error logging to provide better diagnostics
4. Ensuring consistent domain normalization across all files

## Environment Variable Guidance

For proper Auth0 configuration, we recommend setting both of these variables to the same value:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=auth.dottapps.com
AUTH0_DOMAIN=auth.dottapps.com
```

The application will now handle missing or misconfigured domains gracefully by defaulting to `auth.dottapps.com`.

## Technical Details

1. **Auth0 Configuration File**: Now properly validates both environment variables and falls back gracefully
2. **Login Route Handler**: No longer returns 500 errors, instead corrects domain issues automatically
3. **Main Auth0 Route Handler**: Consistent handling with the login route for unified behavior

This fix ensures that regardless of which environment variables are set, the authentication flow will work consistently.
