# Dashboard Triple Re-rendering Fix

## Overview

This script fixes an issue where the dashboard re-renders three times after signing in, causing performance issues and potential data loading race conditions.

## Implementation Details

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-04-30  
**File:** `/scripts/Version0008_fix_dashboard_triple_rerender.js`

### Problem Description

The dashboard is experiencing a triple re-render issue after authentication due to several factors:
1. Race conditions between user profile data loading and authentication state
2. Multiple components triggering state updates at the same time
3. Lack of proper debouncing for API requests and re-renders
4. React component lifecycle issues causing unnecessary remounts

### Solution

The script implements the following fixes:

1. **Enhanced Debouncing**: Implements time-based debouncing for component renders and API requests.
2. **Render Tracking**: Uses a counter to limit the number of renders within a time window.
3. **React API Patching**: Intercepts `React.createElement` to prevent duplicate renders of key components.
4. **API Request Caching**: Prevents duplicate profile API requests by caching responses.
5. **APP_CACHE Integration**: Utilizes the APP_CACHE for storing render state and component tracking.

### Key Functions

- `applyGlobalFixes()`: Applies patches to global objects to prevent excessive re-renders
- `initializeFixScript()`: Initializes the fix script and sets up tracking

### Technical Implementation

The script uses the following techniques to fix the issues:
- Monkey patching React's createElement method to add render debouncing
- Intercepting fetch API calls to prevent duplicate profile data requests
- Using APP_CACHE for persistent state tracking across renders
- Implementing cooldown periods between allowed renders

## Usage

The script automatically loads and applies the fixes when the page loads. No manual intervention is required.

## Dependencies

- Requires window.__APP_CACHE to be accessible
- Works with React-based applications
