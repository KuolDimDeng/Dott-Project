# Version0012 Fix: DashAppBar Authentication and Business Name

## Summary
This script fixes the issues with blank business name and user initials in the DashAppBar by addressing authentication problems, tenant ID casing inconsistencies, and URL parameter decoding.

## Version
1.0.0 (2025-05-15)

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/utils/CognitoAttributes.js` - Updated to use consistent tenant ID attribute naming
- `/frontend/pyfactor_next/src/app/dashboard/components/DashAppBar.js` - Added client-side fix script
- Created `/frontend/pyfactor_next/public/scripts/Version0012_fix_DashAppBar_authentication_BusinessName.js` - Client-side fix script

## Issues Fixed
1. **Authentication Failures**: Fixed "Auth UserPool not configured" errors by adding better client-side fallbacks
2. **Tenant ID Casing**: Corrected the inconsistent use of `custom:tenant_ID` vs `custom:tenant_id` in the CognitoAttributes utility
3. **URL Parameter Decoding**: Added proper handling for double-encoded tenant name in URL parameters
4. **Empty UI Elements**: Ensured business name and user initials display correctly even when authentication is not fully completed

## Implementation Details
1. **CognitoAttributes Fix**: 
   - Changed `TENANT_ID` constant to use `custom:tenant_id` (lowercase)
   - Added `custom:tenant_ID` (uppercase) to the fallback mappings

2. **Client-Side Script**:
   - Creates an observer to detect when UI elements are added to the DOM
   - Extracts tenant data from URL parameters, properly decoding double-encoded values
   - Retrieves user data from the global APP_CACHE
   - Updates the business name and user initials UI elements
   - Updates the APP_CACHE for future reference

3. **DashAppBar Integration**:
   - Added the fix script to the DashAppBar component
   - Ensures script runs on the client side only

## Execution
The script was executed on 2025-04-30 and performed the following actions:
- Created backups of modified files
- Updated CognitoAttributes.js to use consistent attribute naming
- Created a client-side fix script in the public folder
- Updated DashAppBar.js to include the fix script

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Open the dashboard page
2. Check that business name appears in the header
3. Check that user initials appear in the avatar
4. Verify proper handling of URL parameters

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, restore from backups in `/scripts/backups/`.

## Future Improvements
- Consider integrating the fix directly into the DashAppBar component rather than using a separate script
- Add better error handling for authentication issues in the main application
- Improve caching strategy for user and tenant data
