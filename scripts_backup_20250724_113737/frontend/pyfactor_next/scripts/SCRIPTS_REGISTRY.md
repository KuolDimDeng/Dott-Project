# Frontend Scripts Registry

This file tracks all scripts created for frontend modifications, fixes, and implementations.

## Script Inventory

| Version | Script Name | Description | Date | Status |
|---------|------------|-------------|------|--------|
| 0001 | `Version0001_ConnectBankImplementation_listItems.js` | Implement Connect Bank functionality | 2025-04-28 | Applied |
| 0003 | `Version0003_Fix_Banking_Menu_Handler.js` | Fix Banking Menu Handler | 2025-04-28 | Applied |

## Usage Guidelines

1. All scripts should follow the naming convention: `Version<number>_<description>_<file_modified>.js`
2. Scripts should be documented with a header explaining their purpose
3. Before executing any script, back up affected files
4. Each script should be listed in this registry with current status
5. Scripts should handle errors gracefully and provide logging

## Execution Status Definitions

- **Applied**: Script has been executed and changes are in production
- **Pending**: Script has been created but not yet executed
- **Deprecated**: Script is no longer applicable but kept for historical purposes
- **Failed**: Script execution failed and requires investigation

## Important Notes

- Scripts should create backups of files before modifying them
- All scripts should be tested in a development environment before applying to production
- After applying changes, validate that the functionality works as expected
