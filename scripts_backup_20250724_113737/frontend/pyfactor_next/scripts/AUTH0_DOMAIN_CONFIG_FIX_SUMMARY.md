# Auth0 Domain Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem

Users were encountering 500 Internal Server Error when accessing `https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login`. The error appears to be related to Auth0 domain configuration issues and conflicts between different auth route handlers.

Key issues identified:

1. **Duplicate Domain Property**: The `auth0.js` configuration had a duplicate `domain` property, which would cause the second declaration to overwrite the first one.

2. **Domain Validation Issues**: The validation logic for the Auth0 domain was not properly handling all edge cases.

3. **Route Handler Conflicts**: Both a dedicated login route and the catch-all [...auth0] route were attempting to handle login requests without proper coordination.

4. **Middleware Rewrite**: The middleware was adding special handling for auth routes which might be interfering with the login process.

5. **Custom Domain Handling**: The Auth0 configuration was set to use `auth.dottapps.com` as the custom domain, but there might be issues in how this custom domain is processed throughout the auth flow.

## Solution

The fix for these issues involves several coordinated changes:

### 1. Fix Duplicate Domain Property in Auth0 Config

Fixed the duplicate domain declaration in `src/config/auth0.js` by removing the redundant property and ensuring proper domain handling:

```javascript
// BEFORE (problematic code)
const config = {
  useJwtAuth: true, // Force JWT auth
  disableJwe: true, // Explicitly disable JWE tokens
  domain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN || 'auth.dottapps.com',
  // Ensure domain doesn't have protocol prefix
  domain: (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN || 'auth.dottapps.com').replace(/^https?:\/\//, ''),
  audience: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE || 'https://api.dottapps.com',
  // ...
}

// AFTER (fixed code)
const config = {
  useJwtAuth: true, // Force JWT auth
  disableJwe: true, // Explicitly disable JWE tokens
  // Ensure domain doesn't have protocol prefix
  domain: (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN || 'auth.dottapps.com').replace(/^https?:\/\//, ''),
  audience: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE || 'https://api.dottapps.com',
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Enhance Domain Validation

Added more robust domain validation in the login route handler to properly handle various edge cases:

- Checking for missing dots in domain names
- Ensuring domains don't include protocol prefixes
- Adding more detailed error responses with debugging information

### 3. Resolve Route Handler Conflicts

Updated the catch-all [...auth0] route handler to properly coordinate with the dedicated login route:

- Added detection to determine if the request is coming directly to the catch-all route or via a specific route
- Deferring to the dedicated route handler when appropriate
- Enhanced logging to track the flow of requests

### 4. Improve Error Handling

Enhanced error responses to include more diagnostic information:

- Added domain and base URL information to error responses
- Including client ID availability status in error messages
- Added more detailed logging throughout the auth flow

## Implementation

These fixes have been implemented in the script `Version0136_fix_auth0_domain_mismatch.mjs`, which modifies the following files:

1. `src/config/auth0.js` - Fixed configuration issues
2. `src/app/api/auth/login/route.js` - Enhanced validation and error handling
3. `src/app/api/auth/[...auth0]/route.js` - Resolved route conflicts

## Deployment

This fix has been deployed to production via the Dott_Main_Dev_Deploy branch.

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Navigate to `https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login`
2. The page should redirect to the Auth0 login page at `https://auth.dottapps.com/authorize?...`
3. After login, you should be redirected back to the application with a successful authentication

If errors persist, check the server logs for detailed error messages that include domain validation information.
