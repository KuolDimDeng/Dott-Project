/**
 * Script: Version0006_fix_session_verification_403
 * Purpose: Fix session verification failing and Stripe webhook 403 errors
 * Date: 2025-01-17
 * 
 * Issue:
 * 1. Users getting "Session not ready after multiple attempts" error when signing in after cache clear
 * 2. Stripe webhooks getting 403 Forbidden due to authentication requirement
 * 
 * Root Cause:
 * 1. Session cookie detection logic was too strict, not accounting for cookies being set
 * 2. Stripe webhook path was not in the public paths list for RLS middleware
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 1. Enhanced verify-session-ready to detect cookies in the process of being set
 * 2. Added Stripe webhook path to public_paths in enhanced_rls_middleware.py
 * 3. Added retry logic in EmailPasswordSignIn when session is being set
 * 
 * Changes:
 * 1. Updated: /backend/pyfactor/custom_auth/enhanced_rls_middleware.py
 *    - Added '/api/onboarding/webhooks/stripe/' to public_paths
 * 2. Updated: /src/app/api/auth/verify-session-ready/route.js
 *    - Added detection for cookies in headers that aren't parsed yet
 *    - Returns retry:true when cookie is being set
 * 3. Updated: /src/components/auth/EmailPasswordSignIn.js
 *    - Added handling for retry case from verify-session-ready
 * 4. Updated: /backend/pyfactor/onboarding/urls.py
 *    - Added comment that webhook route requires no auth
