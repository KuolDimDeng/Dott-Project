# Auth0 Login 500 Error Domain Fix

## Problem Description

Users experienced a 500 Internal Server Error when accessing the login endpoint at `https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login`. 
This endpoint is responsible for redirecting users to Auth0 for authentication.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Custom Domain Configuration**: The Auth0 domain was set to `auth.dottapps.com` which is a custom domain. 
   This required proper verification and configuration in the Auth0 dashboard.

2. **Domain Handling Issues**: The code contained duplicate domain properties in the Auth0 configuration and
   lacked robust domain normalization in the login route.

3. **Limited Error Telemetry**: The error handling wasn't capturing enough details to properly diagnose the issue.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Auth0 Configuration File

- Fixed duplicate domain property in the configuration object.
- Ensured consistent domain handling between client and server-side code.
- Made sure JWT tokens are forced and JWE tokens are explicitly disabled for compatibility.

### 2. Login Route Enhancements

- Added a dedicated domain normalization function to ensure consistent domain handling.
- Enhanced error handling with detailed telemetry to capture specific error types.
- Added specific handling for network and SSL certificate errors.

### 3. Domain Verification

- The custom domain `auth.dottapps.com` should be properly verified in the Auth0 dashboard.
- DNS records should be verified to ensure proper resolution.
- SSL certificate should be valid for the custom domain.

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Access `https://dottapps.com/api/auth/login` in a browser, which should redirect to Auth0 login page.
2. Check for any error messages in the server logs when a login is attempted.
3. Monitor for any 500 errors in the application logs.

## Auth0 Custom Domain Requirements

When using a custom domain with Auth0, ensure:

1. The domain is verified in the Auth0 dashboard.
2. Proper DNS records are set up (CNAME or A records as required).
3. SSL certificate is valid and properly configured.
4. The custom domain is enabled for the application.

## Environment Variable Configuration

The following environment variables should be properly set:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN`: Set to `auth.dottapps.com`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: The Auth0 client ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE`: Set to `https://api.dottapps.com`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Set to `https://dottapps.com`
