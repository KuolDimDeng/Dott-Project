# Nginx Reload Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment was failing with error: "Command 01_reload_nginx failed"

## Root Cause
- Container commands were trying to reload nginx inside the Docker container
- Nginx runs on the host system, not inside the container
- The command `nginx -s reload` was failing because nginx isn't available in the container

## Solution Applied
1. Removed all nginx reload commands from .ebextensions files
2. Removed problematic container_commands sections
3. Created proper nginx configuration in .platform/nginx/conf.d/
4. Elastic Beanstalk automatically reloads nginx when platform hooks are applied

## Files Modified
- Removed/cleaned .ebextensions files containing nginx reload commands
- Created .platform/nginx/conf.d/health.conf for health check configuration
- Cleaned up 01_environment.config to remove container commands

## Deployment Instructions
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk using your normal deployment process
3. The deployment should now complete successfully

## Prevention
- Never use container_commands to reload nginx in Docker-based EB deployments
- Use .platform/nginx/conf.d/ for nginx configuration changes
- EB will automatically reload nginx when needed
