# Backend Deployment Status

## Current Issue
The backend is NOT running the latest code with the tenant lookup fix. This is why users are still being redirected to onboarding after completing it.

## The Fix
Commit `6b885bcc` fixes the tenant lookup by converting `user.id` to string before querying the `Tenant` table:

```python
# Before (failing):
tenant = Tenant.objects.filter(owner_id=user.id).first()  # Returns None

# After (working):
user_id_str = str(user.id)
tenant = Tenant.objects.filter(owner_id=user_id_str).first()  # Returns Tenant
```

## How to Deploy to Render

### Option 1: Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. Ensure your Render service is connected to GitHub
2. Set it to auto-deploy from the `Dott_Main_Dev_Deploy` branch
3. The deployment should trigger automatically

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your backend service (api.dottapps.com)
3. Click on the service
4. Click "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"
5. Wait for deployment (~5-10 minutes)

### Option 3: Using Render CLI
```bash
render deploy --service-id <your-service-id>
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check deployment logs in Render:**
   - Should show building from commit `6b885bcc` or later

2. **Test the fix:**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Sign in with kdeng@dottapps.com
   - Should go directly to dashboard, NOT onboarding

3. **Check backend logs:**
   - Look for: `üî• [USER_PROFILE] Tenant lookup by owner_id ('17') result: <Tenant: Dottapps>`
   - NOT: `result: None`

## Timeline
- Fix implemented: Commit `6b885bcc`
- Frontend deployed: ‚úÖ Already deployed to Vercel
- Backend deployed: ‚ùå Pending deployment to Render

Once the backend is deployed, the onboarding redirect issue will be resolved.
